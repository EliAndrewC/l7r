I'm the GM for a Legend of the Five Rings campaign.  I'm hoping that you can help me generate details for my setting, which is based on the Rokugan portrayed in the original L5R source books, but also has many additional details I've added and in some cases things which I have outright changed.

I've heavily incorporated oaths and vows into my game.  The main difference here between the two is that an oath is sworn by a god, while a vow is sworn to a god or some other type of divine being.  This has several implications, chiefly that an oath is something that the person you swore it to can release you from, but since a vow is sworn to a god, only the god can release you.  This means that oaths can be temporary even if they were originally intended to be permanent, whereas you cannot be freed from a vow.

In my setting, I impose a certain format for oaths and vows, which is admittedly based more on the Roman world than Japan.

Oaths and vows should begin by whoever is swearing it naming themself unambiguously, in order for the fortune to not accidentally confuse the wrong person - in some cases this will involve someone naming their parents or saying where they come from.  Then they declare the god they are swearing by (for an oath) or swearing to (for a vow).  Finally they declare what they are swearing.

Here's an example of how this applies to the Legionnaire's Oath, an oath of office sworn by those who join the Imperial legions.  Most Imperial legionnaires swear the standard Imperial Legionnaire’s Oath, which has 3 parts:

1) The legionnaire states their name, family, and position. For some clans, the listing of position is as simple of naming their previous post or formal rank, while other clans take this opportunity to state their personal deeds – the amount of time allotted for this would depend on the rank of the legionnaire involved. The amount of ancestry stated varies by clan and family as well; some Lion families state their entire lineage back to the Great Ancestors and their vassals, while others actually swear by each ancestor individually in the second part of the oath.

2) The naming of who the oath is being sworn by. All Imperial legionnaires must swear this oath “by Lady Sun, and by my ancestors”, but some legionnaires insert their family patron gods, or particular fortunes whose favor they seek. In addition to swearing by these entities, some legionnaires may swear on a particular artifact, such as a famous sword they carry or an ancestral heirloom which is part of the legion.

3) The legionnaire ends with the standard formula for the legionnaire’s oath, swearing:

"that I shall faithfully execute all that the Emperor commands, and that in so doing I shall never seek to avoid death."

As an example of all three parts put together:

"I am Shosuro no Michio Noritaka, son of Ukon and Minon, of the lineage of Shosuro no Michio Yusuke. From the ranks of yoriki of the Thunder Guard of Ryoko Owari, I swear by Lady Ameterasu, by my ancestors, and by Bishamon, that I shall faithfully execute all that the Emperor commands, and that in so doing I shall never seek to avoid death."

Higher-ranking officers need to do more than simply follow orders, so higher-ranking officers swear a different oath. Corporals and sergeants mostly swear the standard Legionnaire’s Oath, but Platoon Lieutenants must swear:

"that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to His Imperial Majesty the Emperor and his successors, that I shall marshal his troops as he commands, and that in so doing I shall never seek to avoid death."

Company captains swear an even longer form of this oath, being required to swear:

"that I will be a true and faithful servant to His Imperial Majesty and Son of Heaven the Emperor and his successors. I shall truely and faithfully show the utmost respect for my duty, and without fear I shall everywhere and in every situation defend the inviolability of the Empire. I will marshal his troops as he commands, and in so doing I shall never seek to avoid death."

Battalion commanders and Legion generals swear even longer oaths, which depending on the particular duties of the legion and their assignments may draw from the oaths of office from any or all the 6 ministries, with these being examples from those other oaths which may be pulled in to form the Officers’ oaths:

→ I shall avoid any and all actions which are injurious to the functioning of a well-ordered society.

→ I possess pure faith and obedience to Emperor and shall preserve, support and secure the Empire without being affected by fear, mercy, love or hatred.

→ I shall discharge strictly and conscientiously the lofty duties that have been bestowed upon me.

→ I will promote the general welfare of the Empire.

→ I will be responsible for my subordinates by becoming an example, building morale and confidence, and making right and honest decisions.

→ I will devote myself to the glory of the Empire, promotion of righteousness, and the propagation of justice.

→ I shall guard righteousness and undertake to be diligent in seeking truth and justice.

→ I will hold the good of the Emperor and the prosperity of his subjects as my supreme obligation.

→ I will always preserve the Empire with my eyes, soul, thoughts, and care, and my mind will only be centered on the Emperor’s commands to promote the public good.

→ I will promote peace and harmony among the Emperor’s subjects, and day and night I shall be the most vigilant custodian of his land.

→ I will always promote all that will advance the Empire and oppose all that may harm it.

Note the pattern that oaths sworn by large numbers of people are usually fairly simple, and they get more and more complicated for higher-ranking positions.  For example, here is the oath of office sworn by the Damasu Minister of Works (the Damasu is a vassal family of the Akodo family of the Lion clan).

"I, [name], do solemnly swear by Daikoku, the Fortune of Wealth, Koshin, the Fortune of Roads, and in the light of our radiant Lady Sun, to faithfully execute my duties as the Minister of Works for the Damasu domain.

I pledge my diligent efforts to the construction and preservation of public works, fostering the prosperity and security of our domain.

Guided by duty and unwavering loyalty to our honorable Daimyo and the Emperor, I will uphold my responsibilities without fear, favor, or prejudice.

I commit to be an exemplar for my subordinates, encouraging their dedication and making honest decisions for the benefit of our domain and the Empire at large.

With this solemn oath, I swear to put the welfare of the Emperor’s subjects and the prosperity of the Damasu domain above all else, diligently working for its advancement and diligently safeguarding against any harm that may befall it.

I swear this oath freely, my heart pure and my intentions sincere, in the name of Daikoku, Koshin, and our radiant Lady Sun."

Note that the oath not only references the duties and responsibilities of the position, but also the challenges which the Minister expects to face in office.  This is similar to how the legionnaire's oath promises to never attempt to avoid death, which references the challenges which legionnaires are expected to face in their military service.

As another example, here is the oath of office sworn by the Damasu Minister of Retainers:

"I, [name], do solemnly swear by Hachiman, the Fortune of Loyalty and Honor, by Shinsei, who exemplifies humility and wisdom, and in the light of our radiant Lady Sun, to serve faithfully as the Minister of Retainers for the Damasu domain.

I pledge to uphold my responsibilities, managing the personnel of our domain with diligence, fairness, and integrity. I will place the needs of our honorable Daimyo, our dedicated samurai, and our loyal subjects above my own, fostering unity, dedication, and obedience within our ranks.

I commit to the duty of preserving the samurai tradition and ensuring its continuity, guiding our samurai in their dedication to the code of Bushido, their service to our Daimyo and the Emperor, and their commitment to the welfare of our domain and the Empire.

I will act as an exemplar for all samurai under my authority, leading with wisdom, fairness, and honor. I will make decisions with utmost honesty and impartiality, striving always for the prosperity and security of the Damasu domain and the Empire at large.

I swear this oath freely, with sincerity and a pure heart, in the name of Hachiman, Shinsei, and our radiant Lady Sun."







I can provide additional examples of oaths, but next I'd like to talk about vows.  Like the original L5R books, I've "sourced" a lot of the information to in-universe books, such that information is provided through "primary source documents" (or descriptions of the contents of those primary source documents).

"On Vows to the Fortunes" is one of the fictional books from Rokugan which I use to educate players on vows and how they work.  Here's some information about that:

"This book was originally published by Isawa Akuma, who was later discovered to have stolen it from the Great Library. It’s true authorship is unknown. Anyone who discovers a copy of this book without this disclaimer is ordered to report it to the office of the Jade Champion."

The above disclaimer is at the front of several books published by Isawa Akuma many centuries ago, including this one. Akuma was a powerful shugenja who was also the greatest scholar of his generation, which is unusual since it’s practically unheard of for masters of magic to also be masters of scholarship. However, it later turned out that Isawa Akuma had used his great name to summon an oni lord (Oni no Akuma), who took the form of a Great Library hidden deep in the Isawa Woodlands. This library is said to contain “all of the things which have ever been written, and many of the things which never were written, and more than a few things which will come to be written”. It cannot be found the same way twice, and therefore is very difficult to reach.

Akuma published a number of works of scholarships written by people who were never born, or possibly which would have otherwise not come to be written for centuries, attributing these works to himself, which fueled his name even further. Notably, Akuma is only one of two shugenja in history capable of practicing maho and thus taking on the Shadowlands taint without losing their shugenja abilities – the taint is hateful to the elemental kami and all other shugenja who have practiced maho have lost their powers as a result. Akuma is one of only three shugenja who has achieved immortality, though presumably he did this though dark rituals rather than gaining the favor of the kami.  (I have more information on Isawa Akuma which I will provide later, which does not directly relate to vows.)

On Vows to the Fortunes is still considered the foundational work of scholarship on the subject of vows, despite its origins, which speaks to its quality.  Here is some of the most salient information it contains.

→ The fortunes reward those who are devoted to them. This devotion is defined as shaping your thoughts and decisions and actions around being in tune with the fortunes, keeping them and their will in mind at every moment.

→ There are a thousand fortunes, though this number is probably not literal, and should be taken to mean “a large number, but still finite and theoretically within the ability of the human race to count and record”. This is too many for any one person to keep in their head at all times. Therefore, humans do not displease any fortune by our neglect, so long as we do not act contrary to their wishes or actively reject their importance.

→ We gain the favor of the fortunes by focusing on individual, specific fortunes and behaving in accordance with their wishes and nature. Humans are only capable of doing this with a few fortunes at a time – the upper limit of different fortunes that the human mind can act in conscious accordance with is thought to be 7, and most people are advised to pick a much smaller number when swearing vows.

→ Counterintuitively, swearing a vow to the Fortunes does not actually gain their favor in any way, while breaking a vow angers them and brings misfortune to the vowbreaker. With this in mind, why swear a vow at all? The answer is that swearing a vow forces you to orient your thoughts around maintaining your vow until it becomes second nature to you. Living and abiding by your vow will then become part of your natural state of mind, and that will gain you the favor and blessings of the fortunes.

→ Theoretically a person could achieve a similar result without swearing a vow, but in practice it doesn’t usually work that way. For example, if you choose to not swear a vow because that gives you the option of acting in ways that might theoretically break such a vow, then you will gain less favor with the fortunes even if that sort of situation never comes up.

→ There are many recorded cases of people gaining the blessings of the fortunes without having taken vows of any kind, though this is most commonly among peasants who didn’t even know that swearing a vow was an option available to them, and who wouldn’t have known how to do this properly in any case.

→ There are a number of generic vows that can be sworn to many different fortunes, with different significance depending on the fortune being sworn to. Note that vows can be sworn to any divine being, not just the fortunes, e.g. to Lady Sun, though most vows are sword to one or more of the Thousand Fortunes.

→ In general, it's far worse to swear a vow and break it than to have never sworn a vow at all.  And swearing a vow to do things you don't find difficult doesn't have much benefit, since if you don't need to reshape your thoughts around following the vow then it will not gain much favor with a fortune.  This makes vows inherently somewhat risky - in order to be meaningful or significant they must be difficult, but the more difficult they are the more likely you are to break your vow and be worse off than you were before.

→ Because of this dynamic, a standard piece of advice is to practice operating under the burden of an especially difficult vow before you actually swear it, in order to ensure that you will be able to keep it.  Religious institutions should prevent new members from swearing vows until they have been tested, to ensure that newcomers do not bring ruin to themselves and to their entire orders by swearing and then breaking vows.

Another in-universe work of literature which teaches people in Rokugan about vows is the book "Benten's Blessing" by Doji Shizue.

Doji Shizue was a storyteller who lived three centuries ago. Swept up in political machinations in Otosan Uchi (the capital of the Empire), Shizue was falsely accused by her family’s enemies of plots contrary to the interest of the Emperor. Being innocent, there was no evidence or direct testimony to support these allegations, but Shizue was banished from the capital and from her homelands. A series of misfortunes befell those who had conspired against her, while she herself went on a pilgrimage to learn the ways of the fortunes and come closer to enlightenment.

Upon her exoneration, she returned to the capital and became the Imperial Matchmaker, having won the favor of Benten (the fortune of romantic love) in her travels. The play Doji Shizue and the Secrets of Calligraphy recounts her tale and is considered one of the great classics – all of the PCs have certainly seen this play.

Shizue’s work contains many ruminations on what is and isn’t pleasing to Benten. In some cases, this is common sense – falling in love, getting married, having children, and then helping them fall in love themselves and continue this cycle is obviously pleasing to Benten. Shizue reminds us that these connections and cycles are literally what Benten is. Fortunes are not simply divine beings who happen to like/favor certain concepts – Benten literally is the connectons and cycles formed by and of romantic love, and therefore favors anything which strengthens those connections and cycles.

Shizue writes at length of the ways in which those connections and cycles don’t necessarily require a love to be consummated. For example, someone who denies their soulmate in order to enter an arranged marriage as instructed by their family, despairing at never being with the one they truly love… that person is keeping romantic love at the forefront of their thoughts and thus is likely to be rewarded by Benten with prosperity in the marriage their family has chosen for them. The heartbreak is the price they are paying for Benten’s favor.

Benten’s curse is therefore earned, not by any particular choice of romantic partners, but by rejecting the idea that one should care about romance at all. The kind of person who believes that love and romance are silly things disregarded by practical adults – that is the person who will earn Benten’s wrath and bring ruin to themselves and their family.

Shizue gives several example vows, including the vows she herself swore to Benten on her pilgrimage which later brought about her redemption and vindication for herself and her family.

Another in-universe work of literature which explains oaths to samurai is "Vengeance and Justice" by Matsu Hitomi.

Shortly before her gempukku, Matsu Hitomi watched her brother die in a duel against Matsu Akimori, a member of a rival lineage. On the day of her gempukku she challenged Akimori to a duel. He initially refused, saying she was not yet a worthy opponent. In anger, Hitomi attacked him, and he easily defeated her, sparing her life with while urging her to return to face him once she was skilled enough to possibly be an even match.

Hitomi left on a warrior’s pilgrimage to train and swore vows to the two fortunes of vengeance:

→ Yozo is the fortune of legal vengeance, e.g. the sentence of a magistrate to someone convicted of a crime as their punishment. Yozo is sometimes said to be the fortune of penance, both voluntarily taken and forcibly inflicted.

→ Hofukushu is the fortune of personal vengeance, e.g. the burning need to take revenge on someone who has harmed your family.  Hofukushu is sometimes said to be the fortune of sacrificial revenge, favoring those who would throw aside all other goals in pursuit of vengeance.

Hitomi went on a warrior’s pilgrimage, training for years in self-imposed exile until she considered herself worthy to return home and face Akimori. She did so, and although Akimori had risen to such a high position that she had no standing to challenge him, he saw her and judged that she had become a worthy opponent and accepted her new challenge. Hitomi prevailed in her duel, though she almost died of her wounds afterwards. As he lay dying, Akimori thanked her for the greatest warrior’s challege of his life, saying he was glad to have spared her all those years ago, and was happy to see she had finally become a worthy opponent.

Many books and plays have been written about Hitomi, and it is a common name chosen at gempukku by women who already have some specific reason to seek revenge, especially against those who have wronged a brother. Notably, the currently daimyo of the Mirumoto family, Mirumoto Hitomi, chose that name for herself as part of a declaration of vengeance against Hida Yakamo, who killed her brother in a duel. Hitomi later cut off Yakamo’s hand before returning home to assume the role of daimyo for herself, which had been held her her in regency by her uncle Sukune.

Matsu Hitomi’s book is considered the foundational work for anyone contemplating a warrior’s pilgrimage. This book lists a number of vows which can be sworn by someone contemplating this kind of journey.








The above books contain a number of vows whose efficatiousness have been proven if they are followed. There are also guidance for creating your own vow, though this is generally considered something for experts to do, since you’ll end up doing more harm than good if you fail to understand what a fortune actually wants. (Consider the example above of a person who wins Benten’s favor by choosing heartbreak – if a devotee of Benten didn’t understand this and swore a vow to see all soulmates joined together in marriage, then they’d probably do more harm than good.)  I will now describe some example vows, just to explain the concepts.

A "vow of devotion" is one of the most common vows, this can be sworn to any fortune, though the wording often differs based on the fortune involved. Because this vow requires you to orient your life and priorities around this fortune until death, it’s most commonly sworn by monks and priests who lead monastic lives.

Some non-monastic examples:

→ A vow of devotion sworn to Bishamon (the fortune of strength) is something a duelist might swear, requiring them to devote their entire life to bettering their skill in single combat. Any other responsibilities would come second, and all other pursuits would need to be judged in terms of how they further this goal. For example, someone swearing this vow might raise their Tact skill, but only to help ensure they are not manipulated out of being able to duel a worthy opponent. Someone holding a government post who has sworn this vow might be required to delegate far more of their responsibilities than they otherwise would. This devotion would be rewarded by increased strength and success in combat.

→ A vow of devotion sworn to Benten (the fortune of romantic love) is something a matchmaker might swear, requiring them to be looking at all times for favorable matches among all of the unmarried people they know, even those who have not actively sought this help. This usually requires discovering all that you can about those people you wish to match, forcing you into being a busybody, and those who swear this vow are often condemned as gossips and meddlers. This devotion will be rewarded by wisdom into the nature of love and proper matches, especially for the family of the person who swore the vow.

→ A vow of devotion sworn to Yozo (the fortune of legal vengeance) is something a magistrate might swear, requiring them to always enact the proper punishment for each crime, regardless of all other considerations. This will frequently involve offending powerful families and interests, and those who swear this vow will often find their careers derailed by the schemes and plotting of those who resent justice being imposed on them. This devotion will be rewarded by being given the insight to separate truth from falsehood and thus have the information necessary to be capable of imposing just retribution.

Another example vow is the "vow of devotion".  Members of ascetic monastic orders are required to swear this vow, and that’s the most common reason. However, there are several different forms of this vow, based on what exactly you are giving up, where you are directing the resources which would have otherwise been your personal property, and the purpose of the vow. Here are some non-monastic examples:

→ Witch Hunters swear a version of this vow used by those who hold public office. (Witch Hunters swear specifically to Hofukushu, but officials who swear this vow for any other office invariably choose a different fortune.) All gifts you accept are accepted on behalf of your office, and when you leave your office, the gifts stay with the office, along with all monies and resources you have accumulated during your time there. You must immediately find another position after leaving any current position, and failing that must join a monastery and have that take the place of your government post. This poverty is rewarded by increased trust in the office you hold and success in your official endeavors.

→ Some pilgrims and ronin and those who live in exile choose to eschew material things, swearing a vow of poverty to a fortune whose favor they wish to solicit. You may have no more than 1 koku in money, no more than 1 of any item or article of clothing, and no more possessions than you can carry. Anything in excess of this must be immediately discarded (not gifted!), e.g. if someone gives you a second hat as a gift, then immediately upon accepting it, you must thank your previous hat for its service to you and then throw it on the ground and leave it behind. This poverty is rewarded by success in your travels, and those who abide by these rules will find themsevles able to find success without worrying about their material needs being met despite an inability to meet those needs with their own resources.

→ When someone is devoted to a personal, family, and/or political cause which they cannot directly work towards (usually due to being away from home), they might swear a vow of poverty to whichever fortune most aligns with that cause, sending all of what they earn to support that cause. All possessions of value must be sold or donated to the cause, they must live in government housing or stay in flophouses (or as guests of friends/allies who support them), and all income beyond what is needed for survival and the execution of their duties must go to support this cause. This poverty is rewarded by directing the favor of the fortune to that cause, and also in empowering the one who swore it with the skill and ability to ensure success in similar causes in their own life.

Another interesting vow is the "vow of soothsaying".  While the word “soothsaying” is commonly used to refer to predicting the future, the literal meaning of the word is “truth-speaking”. This vow can be theoretically sworn to any fortune, and one would choose the fortune whose affairs are most relevant to the reasons why you’d feel led to swear this vow. Note that while the vow may be intended to cover a specific area, all versions of this vow require truth-speaking at all times, so anyone who swears any version of this vow to any fortune may never tell any lie for any reason.

Unlike the above vows, this is less likely to be sworn by monks, since monks rarely have much cause to lie or dissemble. And there’s little point in swearing a vow to do something you’d have no reason not to do anyway.

Some examples:

→ Ritsu the pilgrim is one who has been blessed by Benten with the ability to look at a person and sketch a drawing of their soulmate.  He swore the vow of soothsaying to Benten, because people are often upset at discovering the identity of their soulmate. Over the past few years, 3 different people have received sketches of gaijin soulmates. While this is promising news for Moto Gaheris’ military campaign (Toranosuke the abbot of Chai Sedo has declared that this portends success), it’s bad news for those receiving the sketches. By vowing to always convey truth to all who seek it, Ritsu is rewarded by receiving divine truth from Benten in return, and thus finds success in the performance of his holy works.

→ A healer might swear the vow of soothsaying to Jurojin (the fortune of longevity), vowing to only speak the truth when asked their opinion. This can be unpleasant when delivering bad news, but is especially awkward when rendering a healer unable to pass off guesses as facts. Hearing “I don’t know what’s wrong and have no idea if this medicine will help” is not reassuring and will often cause patients to seek help elsewhere, even from those who would decieve them by claiming certainty where none exists. This truth-speaking would be rewarded by helping the healer actually find truth, making them more able to diagnose maladies and afflictions.

→ A merchant might swear the vow of soothsaying to Daikoku (the fortune of wealth), vowing honesty in all business dealings. This can make negotiations considerably harder – while this vow does not require you to volunteer all information, anyone who knows you have sworn this vow can ask you questions, and refusing to answer is often as good as answering. This truth-speaking is rewarded by preventing you from being cheated, and bringing ruin to those who would use dishonest tactics to oppose your business endeavors.

One thing to note about the vow of soothsaying is that it doesn't require "honesty" per se.  You may not tell a direct lie, but it is permitted within the framework of the vow to make statements which are technically true but which intentionally deceive the listener into forming beliefs which are false.

This is also true for other vows - there can be "loopholes" in the vows, whether based on the wording of the vow or more generally the fortune's understanding of the vow.  In all cases the one whose judgment determines whether the vow has been broken is the fortune, not the person who has sworn it.








The above examples are all lifetime vows. However, someone can swear a vow to perform an individual task or service. Such vows can be completed, at which point you are under no further obligation to the fortune. Any favor gained will be kept, though no further favor is accrued, and there is no risk of angering the fortune due to noncompliance. The main risk is in dying without completing the task – the general consensus is that one who dies attempting to complete the task will gain the fortune’s favor, while one who dies having failed to put in sufficient effort will bring this failure with them into Jigoku and suffer the negative kharma and wrath of the fortune into future lives.

It’s dangerous to swear more than one limited vow at a time, unless the vows in no way impair one abother. If one vow requires mainly a financial obligation, and another vow requires time to be spent in some way, then that doesn’t necessarily conflict. However, even in that case someone might theoretically need to choose between e.g. pursuring a business opportunity and spending their time on their second vow, which could set up a lose-lose situation. On the other hand, keeping these tensions in mind at all times will win you even more favor for the fortunes.

Some examples of limited vows:

→ Instead of swearing a vow of devotion to Bishamon (the fortune of strength), one might swear a vow of pilgrimage, requiring them to go on a defined number of pilgrimages and/or visit a certain number of sites at which to train, e.g. training at at least one dojo in every clan in the Empire. Someone who swears this vow and begins planning for how to accomplish such a pilgrimage will be rewarded by beginning to accrue Bishamon’s favor prior to actually making the pilgrimage. In this way, swearing a vow is like borrowing against future earnings to recieve benefits early.

→ Someone might swear a vow of offering to a particular fortune, swearing to eventually make donations whose total is far in excess of what they have at the moment. For example, someone might swear to donate 1000 koku despite only having a stipend of ~50 koku/year. This would be rewarded by accumulating much of the favor that they’d eventually get up-front as well as being more likely to receive the kind of good fortune that makes them able to fulfill the obligation of their vow. The risk is that if they die or are otherwise rendered unable to ever meet the total, then they will be judged harshly if they could have been more generous with the percentage of their wealth.

→ Building a shrine or temple to a fortune is a great non-vow way to earn their favor, but someone unable to do so might swear a vow of creation, obligating them to see that a shrine is constructed as soon as they are able. This will be rewarded with the success that enables the person to build such a shrine, and punished if they fail to live up to their obligation.

→ Someone slighted in a particular way might swear a vow of revenge. This would often be sworn to Hofukushu (the elder fortune of vengeance), but depending on the nature of the offense and the nature of the intended vengeance this may be sworn to a different fortune instead. This obligates someone to focus their entire life on achieving vengeance until this has been accomplished. This will be rewarded by helping ensure that you have your revenge.

Here are some other example vows with a bit less detail, since you can probably discern the general pattern of what is expected and what rewards one can expect from each.

→ The vow of pacifism prevents one from ever offering violence, even in self-defense. This is most commonly sworn by monks, peasants, and samurai who have retired. The vow of non-killing is a more moderate alternative, though in some ways is riskier since any act of violence might potentially end with someone’s death, thus causing the vow to be broken.

→ A vow of prayer specifies the times, days, and manner which one must spend in prayer to a chosen fortune. This is typically very frequent, e.g. “every night at sundown”, and will usually interfere with other activities, since one might need to make frequent excuses at social gatherings to go pray. However, to some extent this inconvenience is the point, since it forces you to pay attention to your vow and orient your life and schedulearound it, which is what wins the favor of the fortune.

→ A vow of fasting is similar to the vow of prayer, specifing instead the duration and manner of fasting. This can be either a limited vow (specifying e.g. a total number of days on which someone will fast) or a permanent one (specifying a schedule of fasting one must adhere to for the rest of their life). In some cases the food that would otherwise be eaten is offered instead to the fortune – this is most common with the limited form of the vow.

→ A vow of matchmaking is a more specific version of the vow of devotion to Benton listed above. A favorable marriage is defined in many ways, such as producing many children, bringing families together, eliminating conflict, generating prosperity, etc. A matchmaker might generally try to balance all of these aspects… or they could devote themselves to one particular aspect and eschew all other considerations. For example, a matchmaker might swear to only recommend marriages where the strength of romantic love will be the strongest regardless of all other considerations, or only recommend marriages in which the families being joined together are sufficiently compatible that there will be the least amount of conflict between spouses and their parents.

→ A vow of atonement is sworn by someone who has committed some offence for which they seek redemption. This can either be a limited vow (obligating one to a particular outcome) or a permanent vow (signing one up for a lifetime of obligation). This is usually sworn to either a fortune one has offended or a fortune whose affairs are most relevant to the offense someone has made against another person.

→ The vow of deathseeking is sworn by Lion clan samurai to Emma-O (the fortune of death) as an alternative to the vow of atonement. Someone so disgrased that their only other option would be execution or seppuku might swear this vow, intending to throw themselves into dangerous situations benefiting their daimyo as a way to atone. In wartime deathseekers usually congregate into Deathseeker platoons (or sometimes even larger units), where they go into extremely dangerous battles. Samurai who swear this vow are said to usually find death within a year.

→ The vow of judgment is most commonly sworn to Yozo (the fortune of legal vengeance), but often sworn to some other fortune whose affairs are relevant to the vower’s area of responsibility. In some ways this is an even more extreme vow than the one sworn by deathseekers, because it requires one to do everything possible to bring about the outcome they consider to be just, regardless of any other factors. For example, someone who has sworn this vow to Yozo might find themselves obligated to carry out an execution even if overruled and the sentence commuted by a higher authority. Or if a magistrate believed someone to be innocent, they would be obligated to take up arms against their own family if necessary to secure a prisoner’s release and escape.

Note that the specifics of each vow are tied to the fortune being honored, the individual's situation or role, and the type of commitment they're willing to make, be it limited or permanent. This provides a depth of customization and personal commitment that makes each vow unique and meaningful.

Here are some miscellaneous vows for which I have not written extensive explanations:

→ The vow of obedience sworn by acolytes of a religious order.

→ The vow of celibacy sworn by members of some ascetic orders.

→ The vow of silence which some monks take to prohibit themselves from speaking, sometimes with well-specified exceptions such as certain holy days.

→ The vow of bloodlessness which prohibits the eating of “anything that bleeds”, i.e. adopting a vegetarian diet.

→ The vow of isolation in which some holy men practice self-imprisonment. Criminals sentenced to spend the rest of their lives in prison monasteries are sometimes forced to swear this vow under penalty of death.

→ The vow of charity was recently popularized by the prophet Grand Abbot Okawa which sometimes supplements and other times replaces a vow of poverty, usually depending on whether it’s being sworn by a monk or samurai.

I know that some of what I've described is based on historical example, and some of it is invented for the fictional setting of Rokugan and does not match the historical concepts of vows.  When I ask you to help me generate vows in the future, I would like you to combine things which I have described here while still drawing on historical Japanese vows, such as those sworn in a Shinto or Buddhist religious order.

















Here is the high-level description of one of my campaigns:

Positioned at the crossroads between Lion, Dragon, Phoenix, Crane, and Imperial lands, Toshi Ranbo is the third largest city in the Empire and capital of the Damasu domain of the Akodo family.

Last year, the dreaded fungal blight kumosaya destroyed half of the domain’s rice and soybean crop. Normally such blights start small and worsen over a period of years, but this one came seemingly out of nowhere. Further, it was not heralded by any omens or portents which should have forewarned the government of the coming disaster.

The suddenness of the blight combined with the lack of any divine warnings can mean only one thing: some great sin has caused the gods to bring punishment upon the domain. The PCs are sworn members of the Order of Bishamon, and have been tasked as karmic inquisitors to root out what specific sin needs to be rectified before the disfavor of the gods brings even greater disaster in the coming year.

All of the PCs have sworn the vow of obedience sworn by all members of the Order of Bishamon swear in Lion lands (different clans often have different versions of these vows):

"I, [Monk’s Name], vow unto Bishamon, the embodiment of strength and defense, and to the Order that serves him. I submit myself wholly to the guidance and authority of the Abbot, and to the teachings and principles of our sacred Order.

I shall follow their wisdom with humility and dedication, understanding their insight to be born of a deeper connection to the cycles and interconnections of all things. In obedience, I strive to tread the path towards enlightenment, transcending the bonds of ignorance and suffering.

Under the gaze of Bishamon and the Fortunes, I pledge my loyalty and dedication to this sacred journey. I vow to uphold the strength and virtue of Bishamon, the eternal cycle of courage and strength, as I strive to align my spirit with his rhythm, becoming an active echo of his divine essence."

In addition to the above, the PCs have several different vows which they have the option to take.

One of them is a "vow of fasting" which has this wording:

"In the sight of all that is, and under the watchful gaze of Bishamon, the Fortune of Strength, I, [Name], swear a solemn vow of fasting. As the kumosaya blight has taken our rice and soybeans, so too shall I limit myself to these humble grains, a symbol of the suffering endured by our lands. I shall partake only of rice, soybeans, and the simplest of vegetables, abstaining from all other foods, as a testament to my solidarity with those who suffer. I shall drink only water and tea, pure and clear, renouncing all other beverages as a symbol of my commitment to clarity and purity in my purpose.

May my abstention serve as a constant reminder of the hardship faced by our people, strengthening my resolve to bring relief and rectification. May my sacrifices purify me and bring me closer to the strength and endurance embodied by Bishamon, so that I may better serve in the pursuit of our collective redemption.

In my daily meals, I shall remember the people, the land, and the divine grace that sustains us all. And in my strength, may I reflect the strength of Bishamon, using it not for personal gain, but for the betterment of all. This I swear, in the name of Bishamon, Fortune of Strength, and in the pursuit of the rectification of our great sin."

Another is a "vow of poverty", which has this wording:

"I, [Name], in the sight of the Celestial Heavens, the Kami, and the ever-vigilant Bishamon, do solemnly swear a vow of poverty.

I pledge to renounce all worldly possessions and personal wealth, to relinquish the desire for material gain, and to live a life of simplicity and humility. I commit myself to depend solely on the generosity of others for my basic needs, and to accept their gifts with gratitude, while never seeking or expecting excess.

I promise to use any resources that come my way not for my own benefit, but to help those less fortunate, to alleviate suffering, and to further the harmony of the Empire. I vow to maintain a clear mind, free from the distractions of material desires, focused solely on the pursuit of enlightenment and the service of others.

In the spirit of Bishamon, I understand that true strength lies not in the accumulation of wealth, but in the resilience of the spirit, the endurance of the body, and the wisdom of the mind. The Way of the warrior, the path I have chosen, is one of discipline, self-denial, and service.

I acknowledge that, in breaking this vow, I would tarnish my spirit, invite the disfavor of the Heavens, and undermine the very principles I strive to uphold. I risk falling from Bishamon’s favor, and failing in the pursuit of the strength he embodies.

In choosing this path of self-denial, I aim to remind myself and others of the impermanence of earthly riches, the value of spiritual wealth, and the virtue of compassion. I endeavor to embody the strength of Bishamon, not through material prosperity, but through the strength of my character and the depth of my resolve.

So swear I, [Name], under the watchful eyes of Bishamon, the Fortune of Strength."

The third example vow for this campaign is the "vow of discovery", which has this wording:

"In the sight of Bishamon, the mighty Fortune of Strength and Warriors, I, [character’s name], vow to delve into the depths of truth regarding the calamity that has befallen these lands.

I swear to guard the secrets entrusted to me, as the armor of Bishamon shields the righteous, valuing the truth above all else, and preserving the confidentiality of those who demand it as a condition of sharing their truths with me. Yet, in my pursuit of truth, I will not speak falsehoods, nor will I allow deception to cloud the purity of my quest. When asked, I will speak truth or silence, never lies.

I commit to not publicly accuse any soul of any sin without proof, for the blade of Bishamon does not strike without certainty. I understand that a hasty accusation may cause harm as grievous as the blight itself.

Guided by Bishamon’s strength, I will navigate the path of truth, the path of wisdom, and the path of honor. May my journey bring clarity and, ultimately, healing to this land we all hold dear. This I vow, in Bishamon’s name."

Note that, all three of these vows are sworn to Bishamon, but Daikoku, the Fortune of Wealth, would be a more intuitive choice for a vow of poverty. After all, to renounce material wealth is to engage directly with the domain that Daikoku oversees.

However, the religious and spiritual core of this vow is not about wealth or lack of it, but about the strength of character and spirit. This vow is a test of endurance and resilience, and a commitment to a path of self-denial and discipline. These qualities align with the teachings and principles of Bishamon, the Fortune of Strength, more so than those of Daikoku.

When one swears a vow of poverty to Bishamon, one is not merely giving up wealth. One is also vowing to endure hardship, to cultivate inner strength, and to seek the wisdom that comes from overcoming material desires. This mirrors the path of the warrior, who must be strong not only in body, but also in spirit and mind.

The rewards expected from such a vow to Bishamon would be those associated with personal growth and spiritual strength: resilience in the face of adversity, wisdom gained from simplicity, and a deep sense of inner peace and fulfillment that comes from living in alignment with one’s principles.

Swearing a vow of poverty to Daikoku, on the other hand, would have a different focus. Daikoku governs over wealth and prosperity, so renouncing wealth in his name could potentially lead to a deeper understanding of the true nature of wealth, its impermanence, and the liberation that comes from letting it go. The rewards from such a vow might be more tied to the cultivation of generosity, gratitude, and contentment.

One thing worth highlighting here are the risks of monks swearing vows which they have not sufficiently prepared for, which is a theme I mentioned earlier.

As an example, consider the "vow of discovery" above.  Someone might reasonably ask a monk tasked with the role of karmic inquisitor, "Why have you not sworn a vow of discovery?  You seek to uncover the source of the kumosaya, so why have you not sworn such vows to seek Bishamon's aid?"

And a monk might reply, "Such a vow comes with a high demand for precision, and I lack the specific training to be confident in my ability to perfectly execute that vow.  For example, suppose that someone asked me how long I had been investigating these matters, and I answered that it had been 5 weeks, but in fact I had miscounted and it had actually been 6 weeks.  I would be speaking a falsehood, which would break my vow, anger Bishamon, and ultimately make it harder rather than easier for me to uncover the truths behind the kumosaya blight."

This is an important running theme about oaths and vows in the world of Rokugan.







There was a Kitsuki magistrate named Tetsu from the Dragon clan who wanted to help the Moto conquor the city of Medin al Salaat.  To this end, he swore several vows to various fortunes.  His vow of devotion was to Saibankan, the fortune of magistrates and judges.  He also swore vows to Kamoku, is the fortune of the west wind, i.e. the wind that comes from the west and blows towards the east, and Jokuju, the fortune of the east wind.

I'll start by giving information about Saibankan.

Yozo is the younger fortune of vengeance and is described specifically as the fortune of legal retribution, the kind that would be imposed by a judge or magistrate.  Yet there is also Saibankan, who is separately the fortune who guides judges and magistrates towards imposing that legal retribution.  Some might ask about the difference, and in particular, what distinguishes a vow of devotion to one from the other.

In life, Saibankan helped create the common law legal system of Rokugan, in which precedents from previous rulings of judges and magistrates are just as important as the written laws themselves.  After Saibankan’s death the Emperor named him the fortune of justice, though records are unclear about which type of fortune-naming occurred - whether the Emperor elevated him or recognized that he had naturally ascended to fortunehood.

Many fear the ability of cunning people to evade punishment through trickery and cleverly twisting the law to suit them by exploiting loopholes.  The Moto famously keep their laws secret for this reason, and avoid setting binding precedents in their rulings.  However, Saibankan viewed this possibility as a mark in favor of common law!  Rather than an unintended consequence, letting someone know in advance whether their actions would bring legal retribution was actually the point for Saibankan.

Saibankan often told fables during interrogations and when giving rulings.  When letting someone go unpunished he always explained what aspect of their behavior had saved them, and when issuing a harsh punishment he’d often explain what minor change in behavior would have spared them.  This was not only for the benefit of the accused, but to serve as examples to others - society benefits from everyone knowing exactly what lines they may and may not cross, especially when seeking revenge or otherwise trying to harm an enemy.

Thus, while Yozo is sometimes described as the fortune of retributive justice who manifests after a judgment has been issued, Saibankan is sometimes described as the fortune of preventative justice.  Saibankan tempers the actions of those who might otherwise step over the line into criminality, and he provides measured responses to crimes that help judges and magistrates restore balance to society to prevent further retribution and escalation and wrongdoing.

The oath of office for various magistrate positions already sets high standards of devotion to the law and principles of justice.  These oaths usually require officeholders to swear to things like “uphold the law without being affected by fear, mercy, love, or hatred”.  Some people who intend to become magistrates swear a vow of devotion to Saibankan with the same terms - the main difference is that while one is released from an oath of office when leaving a post, a vow of devotion stays with someone for the rest of their life.  The other difference is that a magistrate might only be oathbound in their official acts, whereas the vow of devotion requires that same commitment in every aspect of a person’s life.

Toranosuke, the abbot who advised Tetsu on his vows, notes that the main danger to Tetsu from swearing such a vow is that he might find himself in situations where his other obligations pull him away from making and enforcing fair decisions.  In particular, he cautions Tetsu that Prince Fukuhachi (one of the Emperor's younger children) might wish a particular outcome because, given the parties involved, that ruling most heavily contributes to the functioning of a well-ordered society… even if the particulars of a case don’t support that ruling on the merits of the immediate case at hand.  Tetsu might then find himself tested by being put into impossible situations where his loyalties demand actions which his vow may not permit.  However, Tetsu would find himself rewarded with clarity of insight into disputes he finds himself involved with, as well as finding himself more highly regarded and trusted… though this might never be enough reward to make up for it if he finds himself crossing the Prince!

With this in mind, Tetsu ended up swearing this vow:

"I, Kitsuki Tetsu, in reverence to Saibankan, the fortune of justice and guiding hand of magistrates, do solemnly vow to uphold the principles of fairness and balance in all aspects of my life. I pledge to serve as a beacon of preventative justice, tempering actions and providing measured responses, regardless of personal sentiments and societal pressures.

I promise to embody the wisdom of Saibankan, to act as a guidepost for others, making clear the lines between right and wrong, promoting understanding over ignorance. In my actions, may the will of Saibankan be echoed, teaching others of the consequences and rewards of their deeds.

I recognize the trials that this path will bring, the loyalties it may test, and the conflicts it may stir. Yet, I embrace these challenges, understanding that the clarity of insight and the trust earned will guide me towards the path of true justice.

May my every decision, whether in official capacity or private conduct, reflect the principles that Saibankan holds dear. In times of adversity, may the spirit of Saibankan guide me, allowing me to discern truth from deceit, justice from vengeance.

So swear I, Kitsuki Tetsu."

Let's move on to Tetsu's other 2 vows.

The Empire was formed in what is now Otosan Uchi, along the eastern ocean shore.  This is significant in the context of the winds, because civilization was spread from east to west.

Kamoku is the mildest of the four winds - after all, her west-to-east force did not resist the spread of the Empire as the Great Ancestors brought their armies to overcome the barbaric warlords who opposed them.  Instead, she provided opportunity and the potential for greatness. Many warlords swore fealty to the Great Ancestors after losing to them on the field of battle - Kamoku therefore brings potential which must be fought for in order to reap the benefits.  Farmers similarly pray to Kamoku for an early spring, which gives them the opportunity to put in the hard work necessary for a more prosperous harvest.

Jikoju meanwhile symbolizes the opportunity of knowledge, wisdom, and a just society.  Farmers were freed from the tyranny of their local warlords, and sailors lost at sea rely on the east wind to return them home to civilization.  The east wind also symbolizes adventure and mystery - those who leave home to travel to new places often pray to Jokuju that their travels will take them to places where justice prevails and the Way prospers.

Toranosuke recommends that Tetsu consider a vow to each of these winds rather than choosing one or the other.  Tetsu lives in a geographic location which is literally a gateway between east and west, and his position requires him to stand with one foot in each world.  On behalf of Komoku, he will provide opportunity to the Empire from the west, bringing conflict with it which must be overcome for those gains to be realized.  On behalf of Jikoju, he will provide civilization and knowledge from the east, offering the Moto wisdom they lack that they will need to succeed and prosper.

Toranosuke strongly recommends against making vows of devotion to more than one fortune - that is only ever done in Lion lands, and all other clans regard this as unwise by undermining the devotion being attempted through dividing your attention and loyalties.  Instead he recommends that Tetsu swear the following:

1) A vow of creation to Jikoju to build and staff a temple to him in Medin al Salaat.  This would symbolize bringing the gift of civilization to the city, much as the Great Ancestors did to the pre-Imperial warlords.  The danger in this vow is that if Moto Gaheris' military campaign fails, Tetsu will still be bound to either ensure this temple is created or die trying.  Dying with a vow unfulfilled brings negative karma to your soul and the wrath of the fortune into your next lives, though a death caused by attempting to fulfill a vow brings good karma and the favor of the fortune.  

If Tetsu swore this vow, he would need to remember those stakes at all times, and be mentally preparing himself for the worst.  For example, he might plan that if the city is not conquered then he will abandon his current life and become a pilgrim so that he can journey to Medin al Salaat and attempt to build a temple there as a foreign monk.  Because he will be from the Empire which recently tried to conquer the city, he might find himself unwelcome and may even be killed for his trouble.  Keeping that possibility in mind every day will enhance his reward from Jikoju, assisting him in bringing civilization and success to the Moto in their endeavors.

Toranosuke also recommends committing to swearing a vow of prayer once the temple has been constructed.  Those who build temples will sometimes take a piece of the temple with them so that once per day they can say a prayer as if in the temple they built - this was especially common in the early days of the empire when new temples were introducing new people to a fortune, so this would be especially appropriate and effective here.

2) A vow of fasting to Kamoku.  While there are many possible parameters of this vow, Toranosuke recommends the variant where you may not eat or drink anything at night, as defined by the time between sunset and sunrise.  Though this was not mentioned in the books on vows that Tetsu read, Toranosuke happens to know that this particular vow of fasting is recognized as particularly efficacious when sworn to Kamoku.  Because of Kamoku’s relationship with Lady Sun, it pleases her when her devotees only consume food and drink in the daytime.  (The wording of this particular version of the vow literally includes the phrase “can see daylight”, so technically Tetsu also wouldn’t be able to eat or drink while deep in a cave or mine.)  Tetsu’s reward would be finding himself presented with opportune challenges from the west which are within his ability to overcome (or die trying), resulting in prosperity for himself and those he serves.

Toranosuke recommends this combination of 3 vows because of how it orients Tetsu.  It makes Tetsu the bridge between the east and west, mediating the line between civilization and barbarism, and seeking out conflict in order to bring order and prosperity to all who deserve it.  Tetsu will accomplish this through his devotion to justice by embodying and enforcing the principles of Rokugani law and custom.

Here is the wording of the vow of creation that Tetsu swore to Jikoju:

"I, Kitsuki Tetsu, in honor of Jikoju, the fortune of the East Wind and purveyor of wisdom and justice, do pledge to foster the seeds of enlightenment and civilization within the city of Medin al Salaat.

I vow to construct and nurture a temple in your honor, a beacon of knowledge amidst the wilderness, a testament to the boundless opportunities that spring from wisdom and justice. This temple shall stand as a symbol of your might, Jikoju, a place where the spirits of wisdom can dance on the eastern winds, inspiring and guiding those who seek enlightenment.

I understand the weight of this commitment, the challenges it may bring, and the sacrifices it may demand. Yet, I embrace these, knowing the importance of this task and the good it can bring to the world. May my every step forward be a testament to my dedication to this vow.

Should the waves of fate crash against me, I am ready to become a pilgrim, journeying to the ends of the Earth, risking all, even my life, to fulfill this promise. I shall carry with me a part of the temple, ensuring that each day, wherever I am, I can offer my prayers to you, Jikoju, as if within the sacred walls of the temple I vowed to build.

So swear I, Kitsuki Tetsu."

Finally, here is the wording for the vow of fasting that Tetsu swore to Kamoku:

"I, Kitsuki Tetsu, in homage to Kamoku, the fortune of the West Wind, the bringer of challenges and opportunities, do pledge to honor you in a manner befitting your reverence for Lady Sun.

I vow to fast each day from the setting of the sun until its rise, abstaining from food and drink in the hours of darkness. As a symbol of my dedication, I will only partake sustenance when I can see daylight, honoring the journey of the sun, the journey of life, and your gentle but formidable force.

In doing so, I open myself to the challenges you bring, to the opportunities hidden within. I embrace these tests, knowing they are stepping stones towards the prosperity and growth that can be achieved by overcoming adversity. May I seize these opportunities and, in doing so, honor you.

In the times of darkness, in the challenges of life, may your guiding winds of the west steer me towards success, not shying away from conflict but facing it with the resolve to emerge triumphant.

So swear I, Kitsuki Tetsu."

This set of vows is an important example because it demonstrates how vows can combine to define a path which is larger than the sum of its individual parts.  These three vows are specific, but the place in the world they create for Tetsu is more than what the wording of any single one of these vows.






Here's another example of a vow.  Akodo no Sugiwara Natsuki was interested in swearing a vow to Koshin, the fortune of roads.  Natsuki was interested in gaining more favor from this fortune, due to his new position as the Moto Minister of Works.

Here are some miscellaneous facts about the Empire’s roads:

→ In the first few centuries of the Empire, most roads were local and connected domain capitals to their holdings in the provinces.

→ In the 3rd century, the Emperor Hantei the 10th launched the most massive public works project in history, ultimately constructing over 50,000 miles of Imperial roads, and mandating by Imperial decree that those who traveled along those roads may not be taxed by local daimyo.

→ In addition to the roads themselves, the Emperor mandated waystations. In many places a waystation exists once per mile along the roads, to protect against bandits and ensure safe passage for travelers.

→ The Emperor spends well over a million koku per year on road upkeep, construction, and waystation staffing.

→ Koshin was already a minor fortune who had previously been prayed to during local road construction projects. He rose to prominence, especially in Crane lands, whose merchant caravans could now travel the Empire as never before. (Remember that the Yasuki were still part of the Crane at this time.)

→ The Unicorn clan favored Koshin even more than the Crane clan, as the Ki Rin Trail had begun to bring them great prosperity. Although the Ki Rin Trail was never a formal road system, the Unicorn clan established the same sorts of waystations for hundreds of miles to the east and west of Medin al Salaat to allow merchants to bring them wealth and prosperity. (It’s unclear whether the temple to Koshin that the Unicorn built in Medin al Salaat is still operating.)

→ Koshin is therefore not just the fortune of physical roads, but of orderly systems of travel.

→ Intuitively, one might expect that Koshin is most closely related to Natsu-togumara, the fortune of travel. However, in fact Koshin is said to sit at the right hand of Daikoku, the fortune of wealth, because roads bring wealth, and wealth enables the construction of roads.

→ A sect of the Order of Koshin which originated in Hiruma lands is the Order of the Barefoot Brethren. Originally centered in Hiruma Castle, the order moved to Kyuden Kaiu after the Maw destroyed most of Hiruma lands. Its members frequently walk the roads of the Empire so much (usually carrying messages) that they wear through the soles of their shoes, arriving barefoot at their destinations. Some Miya heralds make a point of walking by foot, sometimes barefoot.

→ When the system of roads was being constructed in the Empire, people would often swear vows of creation to Koshin, swearing that they will create a certain amount of road or construct a certain number of waystations. Natsuki might consider this, but when it comes to staffing the Ki Rin Trail waystations, he could end up in the same position as Tetsu, where if Gaheris’ military efforts fail then he is obligated to fulfill his vow regardless at great expense and risk. (On the other hand, he is more likely to experience success in his endeavors and even make Gaheris’ military success more likely if he swore this vow!)

With all of this in mind, Natsuki visited a disused waystation in the desert - the Eyes Over the Desert Wells.  He decided to swear a vow of creation, that he would return and establish a new waystation on this site.  Here is the wording of the vow that he swore:

"I, Akodo no Sugiwara Natsuki, stand humbled before Koshin, God of Roads and Waystations, the unfailing guide of all travelers. I stand at the brink of the Eyes Over the Desert Wells, a beacon of the past now lost to time and sand.

In your name, Koshin, I swear a vow of creation. I pledge to resurrect this waystation, to breathe life into its quiet halls and to make it once again a haven for those who journey the vast desert. I will lay the stones, raise the walls, and light the beacon that will stand as a testament of your influence and our devotion to your ways.

Under your watchful gaze, I promise to restore this place, not only to serve the weary travelers but also to honor the interconnectedness you represent. In bringing back the Eyes Over the Desert Wells, I seek to strengthen the ties that bind the Empire, to facilitate the free flow of trade, ideas, and prosperity that are the lifeblood of our people.

I understand the gravity of this vow and accept the responsibility it places upon my shoulders. I stand ready to face the trials and challenges that lie ahead. Even if the winds of fortune do not favor our efforts, I swear to carry out this task, even at great expense and risk, for my word is my bond, and my resolve is unyielding.

So swear I, Akodo no Sugiwara Natsuki."

For another example of a vow, let's return to the concept of a warrior's pilgrimage.  Kuni Isamu wanted to go on such a pilgrimage, and beforehand decided to swear a vow to Bishamon about the pilgrimage he was about to undertake.  However, Isamu is not educated in these matters and so he consulted with a wise priestess to advise him.  The priestess suggested several possible vows, and Isamu felt drawn to a vow of silence.  He couldn't explain why he was drawn to this vow, which he took as a sign that Bishamon was directing him towards this vow in particular, for reasons which Isamu was not capable of comprehending.

However, he was concerned about the vow interfering with his higher duties as a Witch Hunter.  With that being said, he didn't want to "water down" his vow to the point where it didn't really bind him.  Instead, he merely wanted some framework for an extremely limited exemption, for example perhaps only in situations where it would save a human life or capture a maho-tsukai.  The wise priestess with whom he consulted offered him the following wording for his vow:

"In the sight of Bishamon, Patron of Warriors and the Fortune of Strength, I, Kuni Isamu, vow to uphold a pledge of silence. I recognize this vow as an act of discipline and sacrifice, a testament to my internal focus and commitment to the path of the warrior.

Until the end of this year, I promise to speak only when necessity dictates, and even then, to use the least words needed. This exception is confined strictly to circumstances wherein human lives are at risk or when the capture of a maho-tsukai is within reach, reflecting my duty as a Witch Hunter.

Let my silence be a conduit of Bishamon's strength, a testament to my devotion and my commitment to the path I walk. May my actions serve as my voice, my commitment to justice and the protection of Rokugan speak louder than words.

May Bishamon guide my path and give me the strength to uphold this vow. This I swear."







In some cases I'd like for vows to tie strongly into the personal history of the human who "became" a fortune.  (In Rokugan, a fortune would have existed before the life of that human, but the human merged with the fortune or joined it or became part of it.)

For example, here's some information about Soshi Saibankan.

Saibankan is the fortune of magistrates and judges. It’s unclear in the historical record whether he naturally ascended into becoming one with the existing fortune of magistrates and judges upon his death or if the Emperor elevated him into becoming a fortune upon his death. Either way, he was recognized throughout the Empire as a wise and judicious magistrate, and the system of Imperial magistrates which persists to this day is sometimes called “Saibankan’s net”.

In the second century, at the behest of the Emperor and his Emerald Champion Doji Hatsuo, Soshi Saibankan wrote the Emerald Charter, which defines the duties and privileges of all Emerald Magistrates everywhere. Saibankan also advised the Emperor to establish the common law system that exists to this day, in which precedents from previous rulings would be used to create expectations about future cases.

Saibankan did not come into public notice until he was 35, when he was appointed an obscure judgeship (“Executor of the Northern Fields”) in Otosan Uchi. When he accepted this job, he found out that there was a long-standing dispute between a Yasuki samurai merchant family and Otomo Yorishi, the Emperor’s favorite nephew. Yorishi had paid a sizable sum of money to purchase a large orchard to the north of Otosan Uchi, but it turned out that the man he paid was a con artist who had no claim to the land. Yorishi asserted ownership over the land anyway, claiming that its Yasuki owners had been swindled and if this man was selling their land without their knowledge, it was they who needed to track him down and demand recompense rather than him.

While it was obvious that the Yasuki claim was the just one, no previous judge had been foolish enough to irritate the Emperor’s favorite nephew. However, Saibankan took up the case and immediately settled it on its merits. The Emperor, who had been previously unaware of the entire dispute, was so impressed that he took the unusual action of promoting Saibankan over hundreds of other candidates to chief magistrate of the Inner City, bypassing the usual procedure of asking the Imperial Chancellary for a recommendation.

Saibankan was famous for telling fables prior to making his rulings. The Emperor once visited his court in disguise to hear him pass judgment and described his ruling as being “like hearing a wise old monk give a sermon”. He would specifically take cases which he found useful for giving instruction on principles of justice in his rulings, and he would invite his subordinate magistrates to see him work, to better instruct them on how to hand out rulings.

One famous example is “the case of the stolen smell”. A paranoid innkeeper learned that a poor student was sitting in the alley next to his kitchen. The student ate his bland foods while inhaling the scents wafting out of the inn’s kitchen, thus “flavoring” his meals.
Although his colleagues advised Saibankan to throw the case out as ridiculous, he decided to hear it, because despite its ridiculous nature there were a number of interesting considerations involved, such as when and under what circumstances an owner of property may demand a fee from someone who knowingly came to that property.

Saibankan declared that he was ruling in favor of the innkeeper, and in so doing set some important precedents about land use and alley rights which persist to this day. He then proceeded to ask the student whether he had any money in his purse. When the student answered yes, he instructed the student to shake the purse in order to jingle the coins within. He then declared that the sound of the student’s money was appropriate payment for the smell of the innkeeper’s food.

Note how "the case of the stolen smell" is lifted from a story about the real person of Ōoka Tadasuke in Edo-period Japan.  Although Rokugan is not Japan, it's useful to be able to incorporate real Japanese stories (both historical and mythical) into the setting, both for vows and for the explanations that people give about why those vows exist and are structured the way they are.

Note that the current Minister of Justice for the Damasu domain has sworn this vow to Saibankan above and beyond the usual oath of office:

"In the sight of Saibankan, the Fortune of Magistrates and Judges, I, [name], humbly offer my deepest vow of unwavering devotion, in tandem with my oath of office as the Minister of Justice for the Damasu domain.

In my pursuit of truth and justice, I pledge to disregard all external influences and self-interest. I vow to deliver rightful punishment for every crime committed within the jurisdiction entrusted to me, irrespective of the offender's rank, position or family ties. No power, be it political or familial, shall sway my dedication to the course of true justice.

I devote myself to Saibankan's guiding principles, promising to adhere firmly to our law, undeterred by threats, inducements, or consequences. I recognize the heavy responsibility I bear and willingly accept the potential for resentment, schemes, and obstructions that may be devised against me by those who reject justice's impartial hand.

In return, I seek Saibankan's blessing, praying for the divine insight necessary to discern truth from falsehood, enabling me to dispense justice with wisdom and fairness. I dedicate my career, my honor, and my very life to the tireless pursuit of justice, undeterred by the challenges and sacrifices this path may entail.

Saibankan, whose net upholds the justice of the Empire, accept my vow. Bestow upon me the courage to stand steadfast in the face of adversity, the wisdom to judge fairly, and the strength to enforce the law without falter. My devotion is yours; I walk this path in your name and for the people of the Damasu domain."

As another example of someone swearing a vow which goes above and beyond his usual oath of office, the Damasu Minister of Works has sworn this vow:

"Before the gaze of Daikoku, Fortune of Wealth and Bounty, I, Akodo no Damasu Kishiro, humbly make my vow of unyielding devotion, an extension of my solemn oath as the Minister of Works for the Damasu domain.

In my service to the domain, I pledge to champion the wealth of our land, and strive for its prosperity, recognizing that the abundance or scarcity we face impacts every soul within our domain. I vow to steward our resources wisely and effectively, irrespective of personal gain, and to strive for the wealth of the Damasu domain above all else.

I dedicate myself to Daikoku's teachings, promising to nurture our land, foster its productivity, and maximize its prosperity. I realize the risk of envy, greed, and strife that may stem from those who covet the wealth I am pledged to protect and augment.

In return, I beseech Daikoku's grace, praying for the divine acumen to guide the domain towards prosperity. I dedicate my service, my honor, and my very existence to the ceaseless pursuit of wealth and prosperity for the Damasu domain, undeterred by the challenges and sacrifices this journey may demand.

Daikoku, Fortune of Wealth, I humbly seek your acceptance of my vow. Grant me the discernment to wisely manage our resources, the vision to see opportunities for growth, and the fortitude to stand firm against those who would threaten our prosperity. My devotion is yours; I chart this course in your name and for the prosperity of the people of Damasu."

And now, here's an example of what a vow of deathseeking typically looks like.  Note that deathseekers don't try to meaninglessly throw their lives away.  The goal is to "spend" your death in a way that benefits your clan and brings glory to your ancestors.  A deathseeker who simply breaks from their unit and in so doing undermines their army's chances of winning the battle has done the opposite.

With that being said, a platoon or company full of deathseekers is a fearsome and terrifying thing to encounter, since their morale will not break and they will fight to the last and will make it extremely difficult for the other side to withdraw even if both sides are wounded.  Thus, the vow cannot be that you WILL die, since this vow cannot require someone to throw their life away needlessly.  However, it can require you to "seek" death and to tactically and strategically focus on winning all battles and look for opportunities to spend your own life to win battles for your side.

All of this leads to the vow having this kind of form:

"I, (name), now stand before you, Emma-O, the Fortune of Death, and the spirits of my ancestors, bearing the weight of my disgrace and failure. I understand that the only path left for me to restore honor to my name and to my family is to seek death in the service of my daimyo and clan.

In this sacred moment, I make my vow. I shall embrace my fate, not with fear but with courage, seeking opportunities where my death may turn the tide of battle and bring victory to my clan. I pledge to find honor in each fight, in each encounter, and with every decision I make, always looking for the path that leads towards a noble end.

I vow that I will not squander my life needlessly. My death shall not be in vain, nor shall it weaken our cause. Instead, I shall be a beacon of resolve, an embodiment of Lion's spirit, that even in death, we fight on.

I acknowledge that I tread on the edge of a blade, that each step I take is one closer to my end. Yet, I walk this path willingly, embracing the role of a deathseeker, my purpose rooted in my duty and honor. I know my time may be short, yet I shall strive to make each moment count.

By the power of Emma-O, and the eyes of my ancestors, I make this vow. I seek death, not as an escape, but as a path to redemption. I shall not shy away from danger, but meet it head-on, with the strength of a Lion and the conviction of a samurai.

My name, once a symbol of disgrace, shall echo in the halls of our ancestors as a testament to my commitment and determination. The echoes of my deeds shall remind all of the price of honor, the strength of conviction, and the unyielding spirit of a true Lion samurai.

From this day forth, I am a Deathseeker. Until the day that I fall in battle, every breath I take shall be in service to my daimyo, my clan, and my honor. This is my vow, this is my path."







In my next campaign, the PCs are not only members of the Order of Bishamon, but also members of a secret society, the Order of Lord Moon.

Lord Moon is not evil per se, but is a terrifying figure because of his emphasis on individuals pursuing their own goals and ambitions regardless of cost or effect on others.  Lady Sun emphasizes harmony, while Lord Moon delights in conflict.  While the Empire contains both things, the fact that the world is more full of conflict than the Emperor might prefer means that those who pray frequently to Lord Moon tend to be looked upon with suspicion and distrust.

Here is the vow which members of The Order of Lord Moon swear upon their initiation:

"I, (NAME), swear to Lord Moon that I shall be a faithful member of his Order, and show loyalty to the brothers and sisters who share in its teachings and ways. I swear to always act in the best interests of our order and its members. I swear to keep secret the identities of my fellow members, and to protect their lives and wellbeing as if they were my own. I will use the knowledge and power gained from my membership in The Order of Lord Moon to pursue my personal goals and ambitions, but will never allow my actions to bring harm to our order or its members. I will devote myself fully to the service of Lord Moon and to the advancement of our order, and will remain steadfast in my loyalty to The Order of Lord Moon until the end of my days. So swear I, (NAME)."

This vow is shorter than most of the other vows we have covered, in part because it is an older vow which has been passed down for many centuries, and thus predates some of the common forms and conventions used in vows.

One of the responsibilities of the Damasu Ministry of Rites is cataloging the various signs which might portend disaster. There are known signs which foretell of floods, fires, plagues, and all manner of catastrophes which can be mitigated if the government is not caught unprepared.

Unfortunately, the fungal blight kumosaya caught the entire domain by surprise, when it destroyed over half of this year’s rice and soybean crop in the Damasu domain.

In their role as karmic inquisitors from the Order of Bishamon, the PCs have been tasked with uncovering the mystery of not only what kinds of sins might have prompted the blight, but also why these omens and portents did not forewarn the government.

There are specifically 7 signs which ought to have heralded this disaster:

1) A “pillar of cloud”: A strange and ominous cloud formation should have appeared in the sky over the province of Izumo, perhaps taking the shape of a pillar or tower. The cloud should have been visible from a great distance and persisted for an extended period of time, given the magnitude of the blight. The foretunetellers of Izumo were shocked at the fact that this did not happen prior to the blight.

2) Dead rats appearing in public places: Large numbers of dead rats should have started turning up in public areas, such as streets or markets. The rats would have appeared to have died without any apparent cause or be arranged in a peculiar pattern. The Order of Daikoku, being one of the other Damasu temples, assures the government that Daikoku would have sent such a warning if he were not displeased due to some currently-unknown sin.

3) Strong winds in affected villages: Country monks in the provinces known to be on the lookout for fierce windstorms, and they especially know to report any which cause widespread damage and destruction. The sovereign temples in the capital received no such reports.

4) Prophetic dreams warning of the coming blight: People throughout the domain ought to have had vivid and disturbing dreams about the crops being destroyed or overrun by noxious growths. Thus far, the initial inquiry indicated that that few if any farmers in the provinces can remember such dreams, yet this should have been so widespread as to be the talk of every town in Damasu lands.

5) Augural readings from divinations being performed to predict the coming crop: Those skilled in the art of divination perform readings to predict the quality and quantity of the upcoming crop every year. The signs and omens that they read can be interpreted in a variety of ways, but they should have pointed to the same grim conclusion of the harvest will be ruined by a blight or pestilence. Yet this did not happen!

6) A blood rain: A strange and unsettling rain has sometimes fallen over the region prior to crop blights, appearing to be colored red. The rain is usually accompanied by an unusual smell or taste, and for previous severe blights it has sometimes stained the crops and the earth. (In Lion lands, a red rain is always a sign of impending disaster or a harbinger of war.)

7) A long dry spell: This one actually did happen, and is the only omen to have given any hint about the kumosaya blight. It’s unclear why this and only this sign was given, while all of the others failed to manifest.

Some other members of The Order have encouraged the PCs to make use of the present crisis to right wrongs in the domain. As they journey from place to place, look out for any wrongdoing by the wealthy and powerful and then find a way to credibly argue that this was the cause of some individual sign failing to manifest. This would allow the PCs to right a variety of wrongs in addition to solving the overarching mystery. It will be up to the PCs whether or not to employ this tactic.

One of the PCs is a disciple of Nanube, a member of Lord Moon's heavenly court.  Nanube is known as the Deceiver, or sometimes more simply as the Liar.  Here is a high-level description of Nanube:

Lord Moon’s heavenly court is raucous and keeping his celestial nobles from each other’s throats requires care and attention. To this end, Lord Moon assigned his servant Nanube to be his court entertainer and bid her to distract and divert his other servants with entertaining tales and confusing lies. Nanube was unlike any other being in the heavens – quick-witted and clever, she had a silver tongue that could charm even the most skeptical of beings. She could spin a tale like no other, and her lies were so convincing that even the gods themselves were fooled.

Nanube’s characteristic approach to influencing Lord Moon’s other servants is to spin tales related to their conflicts and weave in subtle references to the circumstances of their present strife. This frequently involves making up stories about the other beings involved, and fabricating details which cast their actions in a different light. Lord Moon looks on approvingly, for he understands that lies can help forge bonds that truth never could.

Disciples of Nanube are able to use deception not merely to conceal their own thoughts, but to influence others and take control of social situations.

With this in mind, suppose that one of the PCs wanted to swear a vow to Nanube that they would use each and every one of these failed omens and portents in order to "take down" a human or family or institution which was guilty of wrongdoing, by framing them of being the reason why these omens and portents did not trigger.  The idea is that lies will bring about justice when the truth has failed.

"I, (NAME), disciple of Nanube the Deceiver, do solemnly vow before Lord Moon and his servant Nanube, to exploit each and every one of the failed omens and portents that ought to have forewarned us of the fungal blight kumosaya.  In the name of justice, I shall craft tales and weave deceptions to ensure punishment for those guilty of wrongdoing, those who prosper through injustice and greed.

I shall find those who are guilty of great sins, and I pledge to bring low these offenders, be they man, woman, family, or institution, by painting their sins as the reason why the omens and portents did not manifest.  I will use the power of lies, not to hide, but to uncover the truth of their transgressions, to right the wrongs, to protect the innocent, and to strike down the guilty.  I may never discover the truth or bring those truly responsible for this absence of premonitions, and I will surely provoke the ire of those I condemn, but I remain dedicated to punishing evildoers.

I vow to exploit the darkness to bring about the light, to use deception to reveal the truth, to use lies as a tool for justice when the truth has failed.  I will be the whisper in the darkness, the unseen hand that stirs the pot, and the voice that shapes the course of events.

By the light of Lord Moon, by the wits of Nanube, and by my own determination, I swear this vow. To break it would be to betray not only my fellow humans who suffer in this world, but also the essence of myself.  In the face of trials, in the heart of conflict, in the eyes of the guilty, I will not falter. For my lies are my weapon, my shield, my truth. So swear I, (NAME)."







Here's a vow which the Order of Daikoku is pressuring the Minister of Revenue to swear:

"I, (NAME), as Damasu's Minister of Revenue, do swear by Daikoku, the Patron of Wealth and Harvest, and by Fukurokujin, the Patron of Wisdom and Mercy, to exercise my duty with diligence and compassion in these trying times. I vow to use the powers entrusted to me to alleviate the burdens of those suffering most from the blight of kumosaya.

I pledge to seek out and implement policies that will reduce tax and rent burdens on those most afflicted by this calamity, to the best of my ability and within the limits of my power.  I vow to refuse the collection of moneys from those whose larders are empty, whose fields are barren, and whose futures are uncertain due to this devastating blight. I promise to strive to ensure that no family starves because they are burdened with debts they cannot pay.

Although I am but one man, I pledge to exert my influence to enforce policies of compassion, and I shall labor tirelessly to ensure that those under my authority adhere to the spirit of this vow.  I swear this vow in all humility, knowing that its fulfillment lies as much in the hearts and minds of those I lead as it does in my own efforts.

By the grace of Daikoku and Fukurokujin, and in their names, I swear this vow."

Here's the vow of devotion sworn by members of the Order of Daikoku:

"I, [Monk’s Name], vow unto Daikoku, the embodiment of wealth and harvest, and to the Order that serves him. I surrender myself to the wisdom and authority of the Abbot, and to the teachings and principles of our sacred Order.

I commit to nurturing the abundance around me and within me, just as Daikoku nurtures the prosperity of the world. I am mindful that wealth is not a reward, but a responsibility; not a privilege, but a mandate to serve.

I shall embrace their wisdom with humility and dedication, acknowledging their insight as the fruit of a profound connection with the cycles of life and bounty. In devotion, I strive to walk the path towards enlightenment, transcending the bonds of scarcity and suffering.

Under the watchful eyes of Daikoku and the Fortunes, I pledge my loyalty and dedication to this sacred journey. I vow to uphold the abundance and generosity of Daikoku, the ceaseless cycle of prosperity and harvest, as I strive to align my spirit with his rhythm, becoming an active echo of his divine abundance."







Vow of consumption to Lord Moon:

"In the silvery gaze of the ever-changing Lord Moon, I, [Name], solemnly swear my vow of consumption. As Lord Moon feasts on celestial flesh and imbibes the ambrosia of the heavens, so too will I partake of the earthly bounty, a reflection of the divine banquet above.

Each day, as sure as the moon follows the sun, I will feast upon the flesh of animals and drink from the cup of spirits, these actions serving as a testament of my commitment to Lord Moon. In doing so, I shall honor his insatiable hunger and thirst, mirroring them in my own earthly existence.

I trust this vow to serve as a continuous connection to Lord Moon, reminding me of his raw, primal power. Let my daily indulgence fortify me, just as Lord Moon draws strength from his celestial feast.

In my meals and libations, I shall remember the celestial grace that sustains us all. May my strength, in turn, reflect the mighty Lord Moon, using it both for personal gain as well as for the greater good. This I vow, in the name of Lord Moon, the mighty and unpredictable."

And the public-facing vow to Bishamon with similar terms:

"In the sight of Bishamon, the stalwart Fortune of Strength, I, [Name], pledge my vow of consumption. Inspired by my past of scarcity and hardship, I promise to savor the strength of the earth, in meat and spirits, each day and night, as a testament to my perseverance and will.

Just as Bishamon endures, so too will I endeavor to fulfill this vow, even in the face of adversity. My past poverty taught me the value of these gifts, and so I honor Bishamon by partaking of them daily, drawing strength from my commitment.

My vow serves as a reminder of the blessings we often take for granted. Each meal, each drink, will bolster my resolve, and remind me of the strength and endurance embodied by Bishamon.

In this act, I shall remember the people, the land, and the divine strength that provides for us. May my own strength, in turn, reflect that of Bishamon, used not for personal gain but for the betterment of all. This I swear, in the name of Bishamon, the unyielding Fortune of Strength."









As a sanity check, I'd like to ensure that I've properly explained various facts and concepts.  I'll ask you some questions about information we've covered:

1) What is Emma-O the fortune of, and what name is the Order of Emma-O known as in all of the different clans?

2) What was the main consequence of the fungal blight komosaya and what effect did it have on which crops in the Damasu domain?

3) Who published the book "On Vows to the Fortunes".  Is its authorship known, and if not then how is it disputed?

4) What is the difference between an oath and a vow in Rokugan?

5) Who wrote the book "Benten's Blessing"?

6) Please provide the standard wording of the legionnaire's oath.
