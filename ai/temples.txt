When the Shinsei was advising the Hantei on the new Empire being created, part of his guidance was the identification of the 7 Major Fortunes whose favor would bring good luck and prosperity to humanity:

Fortune:	Domain
Benten:	The fortune of romantic love
Bishamon:	The fortune of strength
Daikoku:	The fortune of wealth
Ebisu:	The fortune of honest work
Fukurokujin:	The fortune of wisdom and mercy
Hotei:	The fortune of contentment
Jurojin:	The fortune of longevity

The Shinsei further recommended that each clan cultivate 2 major Fortunes to be their patrons, ensuring that every city within the clan have a temple to each of their 2 patron Fortunes.

Clan:	Patron Fortunes
Crab:	Bishamon + Ebisu
Crane:	Benten + Daikoku
Dragon:	Hotei + Ebisu
Lion:	Bishamon + Daikoku
Phoenix:	Fukurokujin + Hotei
Scorpion:	Benten + Jurojin
Unicorn:	Fukurokujin + Jurojin

In the late 3rd century, Hantei the Tenth formalized the system of the Six Ministries, and along with it codified the requirement that each of the Empire’s cities contain a temple to each of its clan’s patron fortunes.

My current campaign takes place in Damasu lands, whose capital of Shiro Damasu is more commonly known as Toshi Ranbo, the third-largest city in the Empire with a population of over 200,000.  The temples in Toshi Ranbo are therefore unusually large and well-funded, but the general structure is the same commonly-used way to organize temples which exists everywhere.

The rank of samurai is well established throughout the Empire, according to the system of the Six Ministries laid down by Hantei the 10th.

Peasants are not samurai, and therefore the most esteemed peasant, even if they be the richest merchant in the Empire, is lower in the Celestial Order, and therefore of lower rank, than the lowliest samurai.

However, monks exist outside the Celestial Order, walking with one foot in the world and one foot outside of it, and therefore any monk is neither lower nor higher ranking than any samurai.

With that being said, religious orders must necessarily have a hierarchy in order to run a large organization. Here is what that typically looks like:

An Initiate is one who has begun the process of joining a religious order but is not yet a full member. Many who become initiates decide against joining an order, and this never attain any higher standing within any temple.

A Novice is the lowest level of monk, who has joined an order but not yet sworn all of of their religious vows. A novice would typically have sworn only a vow of obedience to the order, but not any of the more significant vows which help them on their path to enlightenment and spiritual development.

An Acolyte has progressed enough in their religious education within the order that they have sworn a vow of devotion to the Fortune worshiped by the order. It would be foolish to have novices swear such vows until such time as they can be trusted to keep to them, lest the broken vows bring disaster upon the order.

A Junior Monk has graduated in their studies to attain the standing of a monk, and is no longer considered a monk in training.

An Adept Monk is considered wise enough to teach initiates, novices, and acolytes.

A Senior Monk has been deemed worthy to be put in charge of directing the work of other monks, such as being put in charge of the custodians who clean the temple grounds, or being tasked with overseeing the temple kitchens. One of the requirements to attain the position of Senior Monk is a vow of celibacy, and senior monks therefore may not be married. This means that once a monk attains the position of Adept Monk, they must choose between starting a family and attaining a higher position within the temple.

Each major temple has a council of Stewards, each responsible for a division of the temple’s responsibilities, such as the temple’s treasury and budgeting, or its education of members, or the overseeing of religious ceremonies.

Any provincial city will have an Abbot in charge, and even temples in the capital will be run by an abbot if they do not oversee other temples out in the provinces.

For large temple networks such as the Order of Bishamon, the temple in the capital is known as the sovereign temple and the provincial temples are subordinate to it. As explained above, those subordinate temples will have an abbot, but the sovereign temple will be run by a Grand Abbot.

First, some terminology about what we mean by an Order vs a Temple.

The Order of Bishamon refers to the network of temples, monasteries, and shrines devoted to Bishamon throughout Damasu lands. Each domain in Lion lands has its own Order of Bishamon with its own Grand Abbot.

Sometimes people refer to “the Order of Bishamon” and mean the general system of all Bishamon-related religious institutions across the entire Empire, but most of the time anyone talking any particular Order is referring to the institution within that domain.

Although the Order of Bishamon in Damasu lands will sometimes send gifts and offerings to the Order of Bishamon in the Akodo domain, this is more infrequent and informal than the rigid expectation of taxes which exist between the Damasu house government and the ruling Akodo house.

The Temple of Bishamon in Toshi Ranbo is also formally referred to as the sovereign temple, while the smaller provincial temples in each of the provincial cities of the Damasu provinces are also formally referred to as subordinate temples.

To summarize, anytime this explanation refers to the Order of Bishamon, we’re talking about the broader network of all Bishamon temples/monasteries/shrines in Damasu lands, and when this page refers to the Temple of Bishamon, we’re talking about the sovereign temple in the Damasu capital of Toshi Ranbo.

The Temple of Bishamon in Toshi Ranbo is one of the largest in the Empire, with over 200 monks living in the temple complex.  Because this is unusually large, it's not necessarily representative of most major temples in most major cities, but here are the rough numbers for the monks in each category in the temple:

Position	Count
Novices	80-100
Acolytes	60-80
Junior Monks	40-60
Adept Monks	30-40
Senior Monks	20-30
Stewards	10-20
Grand Abbot	1

Most of the monks in all of the above categories live in the Temple of Bishamon complex. This does not include most of the initiates, who have begun their study, usually part-time while working their existing jobs and handling their normal family obligations. As the Shinsei said of the monastic life, “many are called, few are chosen” – there are generally 200-500 initiates, more in number than all other categories combined!

Here’s a rough outline of the Order of Bishamon’s standing over the past decade and a half.

Under the old Damasu regime, the Temple of Bishamon was the biggest, richest, most influential temple in Damasu lands, due to the centrality of the fortune Bishamon in Lion life. A majority of the governments temple funding went to the Order of Bishamon, which made up roughly 50% of the Temple’s funding.

12 years ago (in the year 1117), the Tsume house invaded Toshi Ranbo and conquered the city from the Damasu house. Although during this time they would not have dared defile the temple (due to not wanting to offend Bishamon), they did raid the temple treasury, and their subsequent donations made back to the temple came nowhere close to recouping those losses.

Over the next several years of Tsume occupation, the city was in bad shape, with repeated riots over food shortages and other conditions. The Tsume government cut the city’s finding of the Order of Bishamon down to almost nothing, funneling their money instead to the Order of Daikoku and to the Order of Benten which they quickly expanded using monies which otherwise would have been directed to the Order of Bishamon. They also seized all of the “temple estates”, i.e. properties owned by the temple from which it collected rent.

The Temple of Bishamon thus not only had to contend with the emptying of its treasury, but also losing over half of its funding overnight, putting the temple’s finances in dire straits. The disorder within the city, combined with the Tsume pillaging of the temple’s normal roster of wealthy patrons made this problem worse. Additionally, the temple’s budget shortfalls led to a massive scaling back of its charitable endeavors, which further strained the ability of the city’s population to cope with the new regime. Many monks were dismissed from the Temple during this time, reassigned to the provinces or to other domains, and many of these formed the early cadre of the Baitenist movement.

Almost 4 years after the Tsume invasion, the Lion clan retook the city (in the year 1121), and it reverted to the Damasu. The Lion clan investigated the temple’s finances and found them lacking, and instead of depleting them further restored their government funding, though they did not have the resources to restore its treasury to its previous levels at this time, due to the ongoing war with the Crane clan.

About 6 years later, the Lion/Crane war ended (the peace treaty was officially signed in the year 1128), and the peace treaty involved large payments to the Lion clan. The Damasu were flush with coin, and donated generously to the Temple. In the past year, after the peace treaty was signed, the Temple’s income is double what it was even under the previous Damasu regime.

The Temple of Bishamon’s annual income before the fall of the previous Damasu regime was roughly 10,000 koku/year, which was sourced as follows:

Here is a rough breakdown of what a typical year of income was for the Temple of Bishamon prior to the fall of the Damasu:

Koku/year	Percent	Source
~4,000	~40%	government funding
~2,500	~25%	donations from the city’s population
~1,500	~15%	income from performing religious services and ceremonies
~1000	~10%	income from land, property, and other investments
~500	~5%	income from the sale of non-religious goods and services
~500	~5%	offerings from subordinate temples, monasteries, and shrines in the provinces
Note that all of these numbers are extremely approximate, but they should each offer a rough order of magnitude of the Temple of Bishamon’s income from various sources. One other point of interest is that the Temple of Bishamon in the capital distributes more monies in a typical year to its subordinate temples than it receives, so the 5% of “revenue” is misleading and could just as easily be expressed as a negative.

Here’s roughly what the temple has historically done with that income each year:

Koku/year	Percent	Category
~2,000	~20%	Religious ceremonies, events, and festivals
~1,500	~15%	Savings, investments, loans, land and property management
~1,000	~10%	Maintenance, cleaning, repair, and renovations to the Temple
~1000	~10%	Donations to the needy and other community projects
~1000	~10%	Gifts to patrons, public relations, offerings to other temples, and other forms of diplomacy
~1000	~10%	Funds for subordinate temples, monasteries, and shrines, as well as pilgrimages to these and other destinations
~1000	~10%	Scholarly pursuits, acquisition and upkeep of books, ink, paper, and other religious artifacts and symbols
~1000	~5%	Room and board for the temple monks
Remember that these are all the approximate baseline numbers before everything changed when Toshi Ranbo fell to the Tsume invasion, and the Temple fell on extremely hard times for several years afterwards. This had rippling effects not immediately reflecting in high-level budget numbers.

For example, there is no line item for clothing on this budget breakdown. Partially this is because a monk’s initial set of robes would be provided out of the “room and board” budget, and replacements often come either out of the budget of the senior monk overseeing the job a monk is working, or donated by members of the community. For example, Adept monks who teach the city’s initiates often take up collections from their students in order to buy new sandals or undergarments or robes.

When the Lion took over the city, few new robes were purchased by the temple for several years, and the poor state of the temple’s finances was apparent from the increasingly worn robes which were being constantly patched and mended rather than replaced.







The above sections detail the temple’s hierarchy and budget, but this doesn’t quite describe what most of the monks are doing day-to-day. This is only somewhat reflected in how the temple receives and spends its money, since some things are mostly free and others cost enormous amounts of money.

Because monks tend to perform many roles, there’s not a simple or clear breakdown of who is doing what. For example, consider the role of education in the temple. While it’s true that some Adept monks might spend most of their time educating initiates, teaching and learning does not stop at any rank. Some senior monks will be active in continuing instruction of the junior monks under their authority, while others will be mainly concerned with temple operations. Some scribes and librarians will be fully occupied with copying and cataloging, while others will use their expertise to guide the education of the temple’s most senior members.

Because of these shared roles and responsibilities, any breakdown of temple work will add up to well over 100%. However, this is still useful to help understand how the Temple of Bishamon’s monks spend their days:

Percent	Role	Work
~33%	Clergy	Performing religious ceremonies, rituals, and prayers, as well as guiding others in meditation, study, and training. Some monks specialize in specific aspects of the faith or in performing particular rituals.
~25%	Educators	The most common task is recruiting and instructing initiates who have not yet been chosen to join the temple, followed by the continuing education of the temple’s novices, acolytes, and junior monks.
~20%	Custodians	This not only includes those who clean the temple but also the skilled work responsible for doing maintenance and repair work. In some cases this will require bringing in and overseeing outside contractors for extremely specialized labor.
~20%	Cooks	The kitchen staff needs to be large to serve multiple meals per day to hundreds of monks, and this figure also includes those who work in community kitchens which exist as part of the Temple of Bishamon’s charitable outreach.
~15%	Scribes/Scholars	The temple librarians copy religious texts, maintain the temple’s library and archives, and engage in scholarly pursuits related to the temple’s religious teachings and history. Making new copies of the Tao (and other religious texts) in particular is such an incredibly time consuming and important work which many monks devote their entire lives to it.
~10%	Administrators	Responsible for managing the temple’s finances, resources, and personnel, the stewards and senior monks in these positions also liaise with the city government (particularly the Damasu Ministry of Rites), handle correspondence with other temples, and manage temple visitors and pilgrims.
~10%	Philanthropy	Those who oversee and distribute the temple’s charitable donations, which include not only direct donations to the poor but also things like soup kitchens and the like.
~10%	Security	Responsible for maintaining safety and order within the temple grounds and protecting the temple’s valuable religious artifacts and sacred spaces. Counterintuitively, the Temple of Bishamon actually has fewer monks in this role than other temples, because martial training is so much more common as part of the Order of Bishamon’s religious education. Thus, while some other temples require a larger staff specifically devoted to security, the Temple of Bishamon has a smaller percentage of its members specifically designated in this role.
~10%	Pilgrims	This includes not only the holy journeys we think of when talking about pilgrimages, but also coordinating with the subordinate temples in the provinces and managing the offerings and donations which flow in both directions.

There are other miscellaneous specialized roles within the temple not listed here, but the above should give a decent idea of the overall categories. Remember that the above percentages add up to much more than 100% due to the fact that many monks perform multiple roles at different times.

Another way to think about temple life is to think about what a typical day looks like for monks in the Temple of Bishamon.

Considering the various roles and jobs which exist in the temple, this varies considerably from monk to monk, but I’ll list a few examples to give a general sense of the rhythm and flow of temple life.

First let’s consider the daily routine of Kenta, who reports to the Custodian of the Temple Grounds.

Hour	Task	Description
Hour of the Tiger (4-6am)	Waking and morning prayers	Like most temple monks, Kenta often wakes before dawn to begin his day. After waking, Kenta hurries to attend the temple’s communal morning prayers.
Hour of the Hare (6-8am)	Cleaning duties	Kenta begins his custodial work early in the day, with tasks like sweeping the grounds, cleaning the main hall, and especially any tasks which are best performed while the day’s weather is still cool.
Hour of the Dragon (8-10am)	Breakfast and rest	The temple provides a daily communal breakfast, typically rice and vegetables. After eating, Kenta spends some time in daily meditation, which provides him with the physical rest and spiritual centering that will prepare him for the remainder of the day.
Hour of the Serpent (10am-noon)	Cleaning duties	As the day heats up, Kenta tends to focus on indoor tasks. Note that this cycle of indoor/outdoor tasks is often reversed between the summer and winter, as snow on the ground usually makes it more advisable to perform indoor tasks in the early hours and outdoor tasks at midday.
Hour of the Horse (noon-2pm)	Midday prayers and lunch	At midday Kenta participates in another period of communal prayers and meditation, followed by the temple lunch, which is similar to breakfast in its simplicity.
Hour of the Goat (2-4pm)	Personal time	While many of the custodial staff use this time for afternoon naps, Kenta uses this time for continuing education. He aspires to become an Adept monk, but first he must improve his reading and writing abilities, which he does by attending classes taught by the Teacher of Bishamon’s Wisdom. Once his literacy has improved, he will “graduate” to begin receiving direct instruction from the Senior monk who oversees him.
Hour of the Monkey (4-6pm)	Cleaning duties	As the day cools down, Kenta either resumes his outdoor cleaning (in the summer) or his indoor tasks (in the winter).
Hour of the Rooster (6-8pm)	Evening prayers and dinner	Just as the day begins with prayers, so does it end. Kenta looks forward to the temple dinners, which are larger and fuller meals than the simple breakfasts and lunches. Dinner may involve soup, noodles, pickles, bean curd, seitan, and on some nights the kitchen serves fried tempura or a piece of fresh fruit as a dessert.
Hour of the Dog (8-10pm)	Bathing and personal time	While some of the other young monks venture out into the city for entertainment during this time, Kenta usually spends a few minutes relaxing his thoughts and then turning in about 60 minutes before the Hour of the Boar, when most of the temple turns in for the night. Once his literacy improves enough for it to be practical, he plans to spend this time reading the Tao and whatever other texts his sensei recommends to him.

As another example, consider the daily routine of Mizuki, who serves as the Scribe of the Eternal Tao. She is a senior monk who oversees the all copying of the Tao performed by all scribes in the temple library.

Hour	Task	Description
Hour of the Tiger (4-6am)	Waking and morning prayers	Rather than answering the call to morning prayers rung by the Herald of the Bell, Mizuki instead calls together her scribes to lead them in directed prayer and meditation based on what parts of the Tao will be copied on this day. She invites them to consider the koans and riddles and wisdom of the Shinsei they are about to transcribe, and has each of her scribes select a single word related to their day’s work which shall be the focus of their centering prayer.
Hour of the Hare (6-8am)	Planning and organizing	Mizuki begins her workday by reviewing the day’s tasks and planning any special projects that must be handled, such as messages, correspondence, purchases, meetings, deliveries, etc.
Hour of the Dragon (8-10am)	Breakfast and review of work	After a simple communal breakfast of rice and vegetables, Mizuki reviews the previous day’s transcriptions, looking for errors or areas of improvement in her scribes’ copying and calligraphy. During this time, she will mentor the junior scribes based on their previous day’s output, to help them learn and improve.
Hour of the Serpent (10am-noon)	Management and oversight	Mizuki typically splits this time between providing guidance and advice as needed to her scribes and performing transcription herself. These two tasks are related, as demonstrating how such things are properly done serves as a useful form of instruction for the junior monks.
Hour of the Horse (noon-2pm)	Lunch and administrative duties	Mizuki is typically too busy to join her workers for midday prayers and meditation, and often works through lunch without noticing her own hunger. This is the time when she continues the day’s special projects now that there is sufficient light to write correspondence, order new materials, and update her team’s financial records. When the temple was suffering financially under the Tsume and in the aftermath of the Damasu retaking the city, Mizuki’s team couldn’t afford the cost of the candles and lanterns necessary to do this work in the early morning or late evening, and now that the temple’s treasury has been restored to its former glory she is slowly re-accustoming herself to the new normal.

Mizuki’s scribes are not allowed the normal midday break. Unlike cooks and custodians and lecturers, Mizuki’s team needs sunlight to for their work, and so they work with few breaks throughout the daylight hours, taking their personal time in the morning and evening.
Hour of the Goat (2-4pm)	Personal study	During this time, Mizuki continues to oversee her team, but shifts her own work from transcription to study, diving deeper into the Tao to gain the understanding which only comes with intense and continued study, contemplation, meditation, and prayer. During this time, she especially contemplates any questions she has recently been posed, either by members of her team or students she instructs, or by those she has met with from outside the temple.
Hour of the Monkey (4-6pm)	Oversight and teaching	In addition to the normal oversight and review of the work being performed by her scribes, Mizuki spends some of this time lecturing and leading members of the temple in prayer and meditation, usually based on some of the teachings having been transcribed earlier in the day. Her students consist of a combination of members of the temple library and monks from other parts of the Temple of Bishamon. Occasionally a visiting samurai or pilgrim to the temple will join her lectures, which some have referred to as “one of the temple’s hidden gems”.
Hour of the Rooster (6-8pm)	Dinner and personal time	With the sun’s light fading, Mizuki ends her day’s work by enjoying the temple dinner, which is especially welcome on days when she found herself working through lunch. Sometimes she eats outside the temple with patrons and benefactors, often samurai who have commissioned copies of the Tao, to whom she often repeats snippets from her lectures.

On days when Mizuki needs to leave the temple to purchase additional supplies or handle other business, this is generally the time when she does so.
Hour of the Dog (8-10pm)	Personal time, bathing, and preparing for the next day	Depending on the hardships of the day, Mizuki might spend this time in additional study, having evening tea with her closest friends in the temple, or finishing up the day’s work by candlelight now that the Temple of Bishamon can once again afford candles.

Hopefully the similarities and differences between Kenta and Mizuki can help give an idea of the general rhythm of temple life.

For married monks (remember that only Adept monks and below can marry, while Senior monks and above must swear a vow of celibacy), the personal time is usually spent with their families, who usually live in or next to the temple complex in temple housing.
