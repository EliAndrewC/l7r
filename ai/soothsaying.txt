In investigating the fungal blight kumosaya, the karmic inquisitors from the Order of Bishamon had to uncover the mystery of not only what kinds of sins might have prompted the blight, but also why various omens and portents did not forewarn the government.  There are specifically 7 signs which ought to have heralded this disaster:

1) A "pillar of cloud": A strange and ominous cloud formation appears in the sky, perhaps taking the shape of a pillar or tower. The cloud should have been visible from a great distance and persisted for an extended period of time, heightening the sense of foreboding.

2) Dead rats appearing in public places: Large numbers of dead rats shoudl have started turning up in public areas, such as streets or markets. The rats might have appeared to have died without any apparent cause or be arranged in a peculiar pattern.

3) Strong winds in affected villages: A fierce windstorm sweeps through the region, causing widespread damage and destruction. In some cases, the wind might be localized to the affected villages, or it might be a more general phenomenon.

4) Prophetic dreams warning of the coming blight: People in the region begin having vivid and disturbing dreams about the crops being destroyed or overrun by a noxious growth. The dreams might be accompanied by a feeling of dread or a sense of foreboding.

5) Augural readings from divinations being performed to predict the coming crop: Those skilled in the art of divination perform readings to predict the quality and quantity of the upcoming crop. The signs and omens that they read could be interpreted in a variety of ways, but they should have pointed to the same grim conclusion of the harvest will be ruined by a blight or pestilence.  Yet this did not happen.

6) A blood rain: A strange and unsettling rain falling over the region, appearing to be colored red. The rain would usually be accompanied by an unusual smell or taste, and it might stain the crops and the earth. In Lion lands, a red rain is interpreted as a sign of impending disaster or a harbinger of war.

7) A long dry spell - this one actually did happen, and is the only omen to have given any hint about the kumosaya blight.  It's unclear why this and only this sign was given, while all of the others failed to happen.

These signs contrast with different omens and portents which might herald different types of disasters.  For example, the people of Toshi Ranbo worry about a city-destroying fire, and in addition to taking the usual precautions, their fortunetellers are on the lookout for the following:

1) Fire in the sky: A fiery or reddish hue might paint the sky - this can manifest as unusually intense and persistent sunsets, and in severe cases appears as an Aurora-like phenomenon in the north that appears even though Toshi Ranbo is far from the poles.

2) Unusual wildlife activity: Historically, abnormal behavior in animals is one of the most reliable signs of disaster.  In this case, a sudden increase in sightings of fireflies or salamanders within the city warn of coming fires, and in extreme cases birds normally seen around the city suddenly abandon their nests and leave the area.

3) Smoke on the wind: Without any apparent source, a faint smell of smoke present in the air at all times warns of fires yet to come.

4) Temperature rise: A noticeable increase in the temperature, far beyond what the season or weather would suggest, warns of the heat of the coming flames.  This could be gradual, but a sudden and unexplained spike in heat heralds the most devastating fires.

5) Divinations of fire: Diviners and priests might start pulling fire-related omens in their readings. They could be drawing lots related to fire, flame-themed I Ching readings, or seeing visions of burning buildings in their dreams or meditation.

6) Ashen rain: A grayish, ash-like substance sometimes falls during rainfall, giving an eerie and ominous feeling of a burnt aftermath.  This typically warns of fires in the provinces rather than in the city itself, though it is rarely safe to count on such precision when interpreting signs.

7) Strange flames: Fire might behave unusually, perhaps burning brighter and faster than normal. Torches or candles may ignite or extinguish spontaneously, and fires in hearths could burn with strange colors.  The Damasu Ministry of Rites maintains an almanac of the various ways this can manifest and what each of the possibilities portends.

Another set of examples would be that the people of Toshi Ranbo worry about the Drowned Merchant River flooding.

1) River's murmur: Interested locals are diligent in listening for the sound of the river changing subtly - if it becomes louder then that foretells the levels rising abruptly, and if the normal sounds are replaced by a murmur that sounds like whispers or cries then disaster is surely ahead.

2) Fish behaviour: Fish and other river-dwelling creatures could begin to act strangely. They might leap from the water more often, or be found dead on the river banks. Particularly large or unusual fish might be caught - a fish with multiple heads is a sure sign of difficult times ahead.

3) Water discoloration: The river might take on an unusual color.  A murky brown foretells stirred up sediment from increased water flow, and if the river becomes a deep, unnatural blue then disaster is certain.

4) Erratic weather: The region could experience unusual rainfall patterns. This could mean sudden, intense downpours, or persistent, drizzly rain over several days. The changes might be localized, or affect the entire region - the former indicates that the flooding will affect the northern fields and the latter suggests that the entire region will soon be underwater.

5) Divinations of Water: Those versed in divination might begin drawing lots related to water or experiencing water-themed visions. A characteristic dream might involve being swept away by a river, or walking through the city streets while the entire world appears to be underwater.

6) Blossoming river flora: Plants and flowers that grow by the river might bloom out of season, or grow larger than they normally do. In severe cases, new types of water-loving plants might suddenly appear.  If this occurs in places where there is not yet sufficient water to nurture and sustain them, then it is certain that the floodwaters are coming, and the plants have taken up residence where they will soon be at home.

7) Fog over the river: An unnatural, lingering fog might appear over the river, potentially even during the heat of the day. This is the physical manifestation of the river attempting to expand its reach.

As another example, here are the signs which the Damasu know to look for which warn of terrible outbreaks of disease which might ravage the city:

1) Insect behaviour: Swarms of insects, particularly those associated with decay and death such as flies or beetles, begin to gather in unusual places. Observers report an unsettling increase in their numbers, and in severe cases even the appearance of insects normally unknown in the region.

2) Unquiet spirits: Tales circulate of restless spirits sighted wandering after dark. These spectral figures appear sickly or diseased, perhaps even bearing marks of the coming illness.

3) The stench of sickness: A foul and unexplainable stench begins to permeate the air. Despite efforts to identify the source, the smell persists, evoking a sense of decay and disease.

4) Ailments in animals: Domesticated animals or city-dwelling creatures show signs of sickness. This could be beloved pets, or even urban wildlife like birds and rats. These creatures falling ill, especially en masse, is taken as a grim sign.

5) Divinations of sisease: Omens and divinations begin to suggest an impending health crisis. Priests might have dreams filled with images of disease and suffering, or those casting lots might repeatedly pull symbols associated with illness or death.

6) Aberrant blooms: Certain plants, particularly those traditionally associated with healing or disease, bloom out of season.

7) Faint whispers: A soft, continuous whispering sound can be heard in certain quiet parts of the city. Though the words are indistinguishable, the eerie sound is associated with the quiet spread of disease.








Although “soothsaying” literally means “truth-speaking”, the word colloquially refers to predicting the future. Soothsaying has 2 categories, which split into 4 disciplines, which divide into 8 forms, which are composed of innumerable different practices.  Here's the opening that people read when opening the book "On Soothsaying":

"This book was originally published by Isawa Akuma, who was later discovered to have stolen it from the Great Library. It’s true authorship is unknown. Anyone who discovers a copy of this book without this disclaimer is ordered to report it to the office of the Jade Champion."

The above disclaimer is at the front of several books published by Isawa Akuma many centuries ago, including this one. Akuma was a powerful shugenja who was also the greatest scholar of his generation, which is unusual since it’s practically unheard of for masters of magic to also be masters of scholarship. However, it later turned out that Isawa Akuma had used his great name to summon an oni lord (Oni no Akuma), who took the form of a Great Library hidden deep in the Isawa Woodlands. This library is said to contain “all of the things which have ever been written, and many of the things which never were written, and more than a few things which will come to be written”. It cannot be found the same way twice, and therefore is very difficult to reach.

Akuma published a number of works of scholarships written by people who were never born, or possibly which would have otherwise not come to be written for centuries, attributing these works to himself, which fueled his name even further. Notably, Akuma is only one of two shugenja in history capable of practicing maho and thus taking on the Shadowlands taint without losing their shugenja abilities – the taint is hateful to the elemental kami and all other shugenja who have practiced maho have lost their powers as a result. Akuma is one of only three shugenja who has achieved immortality, though presumably he did this though dark rituals rather than gaining the favor of the kami.

"On Soothsaying" is still considered the foundational work of scholarship on the subject of augury and prophecy, despite its origins, which speaks to its quality.

Here's a high-level description of the breakdown of soothsaying's 2 categories, 4 disciplines, and 8 forms:

-> Soothsaying: the general term for all the different ways of predicting the future
  --> Augury: the general category of soothsaying, identifying and interpreting universal omens and portents
    ---> Fortunetelling: predicting a specific, individual person’s future
      ----> Astrology: not only the reading of the stars, but the placing of observed events within the framework of the calendar and its holy days, and the horoscopes of the people involved (“horoscope” includes matching someone’s “place” in their family/village/class/etc to their plans and goals, and doesn’t only refer to the date, year, and time of day in which they were originally born)
      ----> Augural readings: performing specific actions in order to generate results which can be interpreted, e.g. reading tea leaves, I Ching readings, interpreting dreams, etc
   ---> Divination: predicting larger events not tied to individual people, e.g. harvests/plagues/floods/etc
      ----> Prognostication: interpreting omens and portents and making predictions about how they foretell coming events for a large area and population
      ----> Oracular divination: similar to taking augural readings, this involves performing actions such as disembowling a chicken in order to read its entrails, or scrying by performing a crystal gazing to view an area and read the distortions of light and shape which are revealed, etc
  --> Prophecy: the specific category of soothsaying, in which “supernatural” predictions made by people gifted by the gods with special sight that lets them see different possible futures
    ---> Wisdom Prophecy: when a human is wise enough to be able to generate prophetic predictions on command
      ----> Devotion Prophecy: the human prophet focuses their second sight on some specific aspect of the future – this offers more control but suffers the limitations of the human mind
      ----> Channeling Prophecy: the human prophet asks a god to possess them so they can see with the god’s sight – this is more powerful but often focuses on what is important to the god rather than what humans might wish to see
    ---> Covenant Prophecy: the prophet forges a compact or receives a promise from a divine being with its associated terms and conditions
      ----> Sentinel Prophecy: the god commits to providing warning signs in advance of some specific threat, e.g. Osawo Wo warns of possible fires in the city of Komori (on the Island of Spice in the Mantis Isles) by causing a red sky over the eastern ocean at dawn
      ----> Strategem Prophecy: a god has shared a plan with a human prophet, so that they may help ensure this plan comes to pass, e.g. the prophecy that the 3rd Imperial Legion should send The Dreamer, The Gambler, The Historian, and the Painter should a company and journey into the Shadowlands to reach the Forgotten Tomb on the day of the Chrysanthemum Festival, and that by doing so these warriors can gain power over the Shadowlands and win a great victory over the Dark Moto







Now here's what I have as the original introduction to the book "On Soothsaying":

Everyone sees into the future. Even simpletons understand that a rock thrown into the air is likely to fall back down. We make such predictions every minute of our lives.

Soothsaying is predicting that a rock will fall to earth without having known that one was thrown. It is predicting that a house will collapse without knowing how, why, or perhaps even when. It is having some understanding of what the future holds without possessing the facts which allow us to make such predictions in the ordinary way.

Just as all things divide into two complementary pieces, soothsaying comes in two different forms, augury and prophecy.

Seeing a spider in the morning means good luck. Hearing crickets cease their music signals danger. A red bird flying into your home foretells love. This is augury, the lore of the general form of soothsaying, which identifies universal omens and portents.

While augury is general, prophecy is specific. It is not merely predicting an event, but articulating its manifold possible forms, affected as they are by the innumerable choices made by mortals and gods alike. A prophecy, in essence, is not the foretelling of an immutable future, but a weaving together of a myriad of potential futures, each one hinging on the choices that give them life. They can be prevented, they can be realized, and most importantly they can be nudged in one direction or another. A prophecy can be as much a warning as a prediction, as much a caution as a certainty. Prophets who communicate such future possibilities practice two distinct disciplines: Wisdom Prophecy and Covenant Prophecy.

Prophetic vision of is not unrestricted – it is bound by the sheer complexity of possible futures. All things are connected to all other things – this is the Tao. The Shinsei saw the future of the Empire in his tea leaves, but even more impressive was that he did so without being driven mad, unlike most other prophets of great renown, whose glimpses into the interconnectedness of all things yield equal parts wisdom and madness.

Wisdom Prophets, therefore, must judiciously focus on areas where they have the most insight. Given the vastness of potential futures, a prophecy will never be comprehensive. The particular focus of prophetic vision aligns with the divine beings who granted the prophet their futuresight.

A prophet blessed by the Fortune Benten, for instance, might catch glimpses of future events as they pertain to the dance of hearts, the weaving and unweaving of relationships. Their insights will reveal the joy and sorrow of romantic entanglements, but they may falter when asked about matters of wealth, power, or more mundane concerns. In contrast, a prophet in the favor of Daikoku, the Fortune of Wealth, will see how fortunes rise and fall, how prosperity ebbs and flows across the landscapes of potential futures. They may foresee how choices made today might impact the coffers of tomorrow, yet remain blind to the subtleties of romance, or the shifting dynamics of bloodlines.

Wisdom Prophecy, thus, is a panorama painted in the hues of divine favor, a kaleidoscopic viewing glass through which the prophet discerns potential futures. Each prophet must find their focus within the vastness, must hone their vision along the axis of their divine benefactor. It is this specific gaze, this focused sight, that lends prophecy its power and mystery. Within this discipline, two unique forms unfurl – Devotional Prophecy and Channeling Prophecy.

Devotional Prophecy refers to a prophet’s ability to deliberately focus their second sight on the interplay of potential futures, ever-shifting with the choices of gods and mortals. Yet, it is essential to remember that the ability to divine the future does not come with unfettered access to all aspects of what lies ahead. The prophet, despite their divine gift, is bound by the staggering complexity of the future’s vast landscape. The act of prophecy is not simply an act of seeing, but an act of choosing – a selection process that requires the prophet to focus their gaze on specific aspects of the future.

This is where the unique characteristics of Devotional Prophecy truly shine. The divine axis, a gift from the divine benefactor, acts as a guide, helping the prophet to navigate the immense complexity of the future. Recall the gifts and limitations of prophets blessed by Benten or Daikoku, whose prophecies are focused on the realms of romantic entanglements or the fluctuations of wealth, respectively. Each prophet’s vision is attuned by their unique divine favor, providing a singular perspective into many possible futures.

Channeling Prophecy represents a more intimate form of divine communication, where a prophet becomes a vessel for a divine being, almost always a Fortune. The prophet calls upon their benefactor, inviting them to grant wisdom and even speak through them. This process bears some resemblance to divine possession, yet it typically doesn’t result in the prophet articulating direct words from the Fortune. More commonly, the prophet experiences visions or snippets of insight, fragments of a divine perspective that they must then interpret and convey.

In some respects, Channeling Prophecy is more potent than Devotional Prophecy. After all, it is the Fortune themselves who direct the prophet’s attention, showing what needs to be seen. The prophet is not merely observing the possibilities; they are glimpsing truths or trajectories that the divine deem essential. This direct involvement from the divine being can lend a weight and certainty to these prophecies that is harder to achieve through the personal exploration of Devotional Prophecy.

However, this potency comes with its own limitations. Unlike Devotional Prophecy, where the prophet exercises some level of choice in where to direct their gaze, in Channeling Prophecy the prophet has much less agency. The divine being sets the agenda, guiding the prophet’s visions according to their own divine will. Consequently, the prophet may have less control over the areas of future they inspect, and their second sight is heavily influenced by the interests and priorities of the Fortune providing the vision. This path offers powerful visions, but also a path that demands surrender to the will of the divine.

Covenant Prophecy represents a distinct relationship between prophet and divine entity, often a Fortune. This discipline of prophecy stems from a compact or understanding between the mortal and the divine. Due to its nature as a divine commitment, Covenant Prophecy stands as the more reliable prophecy discipline, provided the covenant remains intact. These carry a certainty that others lack, for the gods themselves have pledged their future actions, under two forms of covenants: Sentinel Prophecies and Strategem Prophecies.

Sentinel Prophecies emerges when a divine being agrees to provide advance warning of a particular threat. An enduring example is the pact between Osano Wo and the city of Komori, on the Island of Spice in the Mantis Isles. As part of this divine covenant, Osano Wo warns of impending fires by causing the sky to turn red at dawn. Thanks to this warning, the monks of Komori can alert the city’s inhabitants to exercise caution and prevent larger disasters. This covenant was established by Kumiko, the prophet who founded the Temple of Osano Wo in Komori, and has since served as an unyielding bulwark against calamity.

Strategem Prophecies often seem nebulous, especially when prophets leave instructions for plans to be carried out years or centuries after their death. Consider the famous prophet Isawa Kimiko communicating the intention of Suitengu, the Fortune of the Fishermen, to have “The Sailor” reach “each of his destinations” prior to each of the Five Gosechi Holidays in “the Year of Mourning”. It was not until Kaito completed his now-famous journey that his dreams were proven to have identified him as the one responsible for saving the monks of Shizuka’s Promontory and the Emperor’s future wife. Indeed, when Kimiko discharged her prophecy, it is likely that there were many possible men who could have been born into the role of “The Sailor”, and for all we know, Kaito was one of many living candidates who accepted his role by setting out on the journey in fulfillment of Suitengu’s covenent.

Despite their ambiguities, Strategem Prophecies hold an unerring promise: as long as those involved fulfill the prophecy’s terms, they can be certain the divine being will uphold their commitment, ensuring the prophesied future will come to pass. Covenant Prophecy, in both its Sentinel and Strategem forms, thus represents an extraordinary level of cooperation and shared destiny between the mortal and divine.

Still, the art of soothsaying is not a mere gift to those prophets kissed by the divine; it is also a skill, a discipline to be learned and refined. The universe is a scroll of enigmatic symbols, teeming with whispers of the morrow for those patient enough to listen. Augury, then, is a method to interpret these echoes, providing a lens through which to discern the subtle gestures of the cosmos hinting towards the yet-unfolded.

This craft of augury splits into two branches of disciplines, both hewn from the same trunk of universal omens and portents, yet diverging in their paths of study – fortunetelling and divination.

Fortunetelling is the leaf-level observation of the cosmic tree, where the winds of destiny are caught and interpreted for an individual’s fate. It is as personal as a fingerprint, intertwining the grand designs of the universe with the path of a single soul. Fortunetellers practice in two main forms: astrology and augural readings.

Contrary to popular understanding, astrology is not just about reading the stars, but also about contextualizing events within the rhythm of the celestial calendar, its holy days, and the personal horoscopes of those involved. Astrologers align their readings not only with the moment of a person’s birth, but with their position within their family, village, class, and society. Their analysis encapsulates both cosmic and societal positions, offering a holistic understanding of an individual’s life and goals.

Augural readings, on the other hand, anchor their fortunetelling in the tangible and mundane, utilizing everyday items and occurrences as their oracles. From tea leaves swirling at the bottom of a cup, the cryptic hexagrams of the I Ching, to the symbolic landscape of dreams, all become messages from the cosmos when interpreted through an augur’s trained gaze.

Divination, in contrast, scales to the heights of the cosmic tree. It transcends individual destinies and delves into the grand currents of existence, charting the collective ebb and flow of communities and nations. The questions divination seeks to answer are larger than any single life; they revolve around prosperity and famine, peace and conflict, bounty and plague. This practice divides into two principal disciplines: prognostication and oracular divination.

Prognostication is the art of reading omens and portents that presage broader events. Prognosticators study the world, interpreting phenomena such as birds’ flight patterns, the depth of winter’s snow, or the ferocity of a summer storm. They weave these signs into predictions about the future, estimating the bounty of a harvest or the risk of a looming disaster.

Oracular divination, meanwhile, involves more direct solicitation of the divine. Through specific rites and rituals, those trained as oracles can ask for and then subsequently interpret messages from the gods. Their practices range from examining the entrails of a sacrificed chicken to scrying with a crystal to interpret the distortions of light and form revealed within it.

Augury, then, is a means for ordinary men and women to listen to the whispers of the universe, to chart their path through the endless sea of potential futures. It is the art of attuning one’s mind to the cosmos, of deciphering the story told by the world around us, a narrative unfolding in every fluttering leaf, every star’s twinkle, and every dream’s tableau.
