Here's an in-universe story, which is an except from the unpublished autobiography of Mirumoto no Ryusei Yasunobu:

**He will offer no answers, only questions.  Hesitate before answering, and ask no questions yourself.  Pay heed to the danger in any question whose answer seems obvious.**

“A few years before my gempukku, I visited Kyuden Mirumoto.  While my uncle attended his duties, I was free to wander the city, content to lose myself exploring its streets and alleys.  As the colors and smells around me began to shift, I perceived them only as different from my home, not recognizing their unusual and alien nature.

“Feeling eyes on my back, I turned to face an oddly familiar man.  Even at a distance, the intensity of his gaze unnerved me.  After a few moments he broke into a sprint towards me, paying no heed to the strange folk around us.

“I fled into a nearby alley, not slowing until I’d twisted through enough side streets and buildings that I was confident I’d lost my strange pursuer.  I said nothing to my uncle that evening, driven by a childish worry that my freedom of movement on this visit might be restricted.

“Ten years later I returned to Kyuden Mirumoto.  Even having taken over my uncle’s responsibilities, I still found time to return to my youthful wandering.  This time I noticed as the clothes became more foreign and the smells more otherworldly.  As I stopped to ponder this, my eyes fell on a young boy walking ahead of me.  He turned, and at once I realized that I was looking upon myself as a child.  I knew he was about to flee, so I ran towards him with all my speed, trying to remember the routes I took all those years ago, but I soon lost sight of the boy.

“I retraced my steps looking for those same streets, but after weeks of walking every inch of the city from every direction I have found only the mundane and ordinary.”

I paused to gather my thoughts.  The monk asked no questions, so I continued.

“I have asked abbots and shugenja and fortune tellers about what meaning this might have, and what I should be doing about it.  When I heard of the prophet Baiten who could interpret dreams and omens, I hoped he would offer true wisdom rather than guesses and conjecture.  But I had just been appointed a county magistrate, and I worried that I would be seen to be neglecting my duties if I took such a long journey too soon into my tenure.

“When I heard about the murder of the prophet, I asked after others in the Empire with the wisdom to guide me.  Grand Abbot Okawa was widely believed to be such a man, so I resolved to make a pilgrimage to Ryoko Owari to seek his counsel.  But I again hesitated and delayed my journey to focus on my career.  When I learned that Okawa was killed on the Day of Thunder, I despaired at the thought that there might be no one now living able to guide me.”

Again I paused, waiting for a question.  After long moments of silence I continued.

“I am convinced that my experience was a sign to set me on the path to accomplish something.  I now see that I was so focused on worldly matters that I may have put my life’s true purpose in jeopardy.  I never would have chosen to sell away my destiny for temporal power, but I fear that is what I may have done.”

“You are correct”, Hoshi finally spoke.  “You will never unravel the meaning behind these events.  Whatever destiny was offered to you has been lost forever.  Nothing you do will ever change that.”

My stomach clenched, and in my shock and despair I struggled not to scream or vomit.  He will offer no answers, only questions.  I fought against anger and disbelief that in this of all situations the monk would offer plain and uncryptic truth.

“What will you do now?”

I stared at him in bewilderment as I worked to slow my breathing and calm my pounding heart.  I opened my mouth to demand to know what care he had for my future.  Hesitate before answering, and ask no questions yourself.  I closed my mouth.

Would I continue seeking the answer to my question, hoping that dedication in the face of futility might restore my favor with the kami?  No, there is no wisdom in self-deception and seeking out failure.

Would I take my best guess and forge ahead, attempting to fulfill a destiny I understood nothing about?  Pure folly.

What could I do but return home to the life I’d chosen, just as I’d have done after serving my purpose…

The world shifted around me as I glimpsed the future I might have had, returning to an ordinary life, content at having justified my existence.  I would have sought a high position, perhaps becoming a minister or even chancellor, and certainly a role model for my family.  But I would have still been shackled by the same mundane concerns that caused me to shirk my responsibilities to fate itself.

Hoshi’s patient gaze demanded no immediate answer to his question, so I re-folded my legs into the half lotus and dropped back into meditation.  In the minutes or hours that followed, I had my first vision, which no words can describe, for the vastness of the way of the interconnectedness of all things is beyond human expression.  I can say only that I perceived my futures, stretched out before me, each one tied to the choices that could make it real.  Although my visions were not yet as clear as they would later become, I saw clearly the shape of my new life.

“My atonement shall be to achieve even more than the destiny I have rejected.  Career, prestige, lineage, these have been my chains, holding me from acting outside of my appointed responsibilities.  All the problems of the world belong to me now, and I will spend my life and death to solve each one as I encounter it, no matter the cost.”

For the first time, Hoshi smiled.

“Would you like help?”

[Note from Yuki: because of the pages missing from sensei’s autobiography, I’m not sure if there’s more to this chapter.  I’ll investigate further before this is published.]







Here are some backstories of NPCs who are legionnaires in the 3rd Imperial Legion, which is stationed on the Kaiu Wall which protects the Empire from the Shadowlands.  Some of these backstories rely on the understanding that the human body can expel and heal itself from small amounts of Shadowlands taint, but that with enough of it the taint settles into your body permanently, making you forever tainted.  Also note that all of these 3rd Imperial Legion backstories are being told by an unreliable narrator, an unnamed courtier who is relaying these stories to an unknown third party:

The legion's general is Matsu Tsutomu.  When assigned to the Wall during his first tour in the Imperial Legions, Tsutomu was almost killed while on a raiding party.  He and his comrades had been assigned to clear out a horde of goblins about 80 miles from the Wall.  What the Hiruma scouts had failed to realize was that a family of ogres had taken control of the horde and merged it with other nearby hordes.  The battle was intense, with heavy losses on both sides, and most of the raiding party was killed.

As his strength began to fail, Tsutomu felt himself possessed by one of his ancestors, who fought for him and through him.  He charged at the only surviving ogre and finished it off with an inhuman display of strength and skill.  The few remaining goblins fled, leaving only five men left alive in the platoon.

Before his ancestor departed, Tsutomu was told that this was the first of three battles he would fight against overwhelming odds against forces from the Shadowlands.  Only through great courage and strength and cunning would he survive the next two encounters.  His ancestor left without even revealing her name, though Tsutomu later learned through research and augury that it was Matsu Mori, who died gloriously fighting against the Maw.

Tsutomu eventually reenlisted in the Imperial Legions and volunteered to be sent back to the Wall, eager to fulfill his destiny no matter the risk to himself.  He trained obsessively to make himself stronger and studied all the Shadowlands lore available to him.  His skill and expertise led him to quickly rise through the ranks of the Legion, and by the time he reenlisted for a third tour he was already a Company captain.

Nine years after his first great battle, Tsutomu was leading another raiding party, which came across a small nest of goblins.  The goblins fled immediately upon seeing the superior force, but they ran away from the water of the closest swamp and instead headed into the trees of the nearby forest.  Tsutomu was suspicious and sent his best scouts ahead of the platoon to determine whether this was a trap; goblins are occasionally capable of such trickery, and ogres who dominate local goblin hordes can be extremely cunning.

Sure enough, his scouts returned with reports of a far larger force than the platoon could comfortably defeat, waiting to surround them once they entered the trees.  Tsutomu worried that if he turned back to get reinforcements, they would be followed and might not be able to win the battle, even on open ground.  So instead he had his men retreat to the closest hill and hastily construct what fortifications they could.  His scouts crept to the edge of the forest and shot the closest goblins they could find, making much noise before running speedily back to the fortified platoon.  The goblins’ nature compelled them to give chase, and soon the entire horde was rushing to the top of the hill to confront the platoon.

Even with their successful plan, it was a grueling fight, and nearly a third of the platoon was killed before the goblins’ resolve broke and they fled.  Tsutomu was once again hailed as a hero, and eventually promoted to Battalion commander.  He further gained more respect from the Crab by quelling discontent against the Hiruma scouts who had once again failed to gather accurate information on the size of the goblin hordes less than 100 miles from the Wall.

A few months later while visiting his home in Matsu lands, Tsutomu awoke in the middle of the night in a cold sweat, terrified that his homeland would be attacked by Shadowlands forces.  He could not remember his dream, but the thought was crystal clear in his head that his presence was putting his homeland in danger.  Shaking uncontrollably from the weight of divine revelation, Tsutomu realized that because he was destined to once again face overwhelming Shadowlands forces, the further he went from the Wall, the larger a Shadowlands force would be required to smash through the Empire’s defenses to reach him.

Panicked, he departed immediately, and despite the protests from his family he declared that he would not return home until his destiny had been fulfilled.  Many have privately mocked him for holding such a narcissistic belief that he might destroy the Empire simply by traveling north.  Others have respectfully attempted to educate him on the traditional doctrines on prophecy, explaining that such fears are unfounded.  Tsutomu is unwavering, and contends that even if the chance of catastrophe is small, any risk of such absolute destruction is unacceptable.  Even most who deride his concerns are moved by his sense of duty and self-sacrifice.

It has now been almost two decades since his last great battle.  Now that he is well into his 40s, many wonder how long he can remain in command before being forced into retirement.  Tsutomu is convinced that the Day of Thunder heralds dangerous times ahead, and believes it will not be long before his destiny is fulfilled.

Let us now consider the ambiguities and interpretations of this story.

Matsu Tsutomu's experiences hold considerable ambiguity. At the core, there are two main incidents that appear supernatural: his alleged possession by an ancestor, Matsu Mori, during a battle, and his premonitory intuition or dream hinting at a disaster striking his homeland.

From a mundane perspective, it's plausible that Tsutomu, under the extreme stress of battle, might have experienced what is commonly termed a "hysterical strength" phenomenon. This could explain the "inhuman display of strength and skill" he manifested to defeat the ogre. His conviction of possession by Matsu Mori might have been a psychological reaction, perhaps a dissociative state, in response to an intense, life-threatening situation.

His premonitory intuition or dream could be attributed to an anxious mind grappling with the pressure and responsibility of his position. Constant exposure to the threat of the Shadowlands could have fed his subconscious fears, manifesting as a nightmare or waking premonition of disaster.

From a supernatural perspective, within Rokugan's cosmology, his experiences take on a different hue. Rokugani tradition is steeped in ancestral reverence, and the belief in ancestral spirits guiding or intervening in the lives of the living is commonplace. Tsutomu being possessed by his ancestor, Matsu Mori, during a critical battle aligns with this worldview. Similarly, his premonitory dream could be seen as a gift of foresight, a divine warning or omen from the Kami, reinforcing his connection to supernatural forces and destiny.

Current Influence:

Regardless of the nature of Tsutomu's experiences, they've indelibly shaped his worldview and guide his decisions as the general of the 1st Imperial legion.

His purported possession by Matsu Mori fostered in him a deep-seated belief in destiny and a sense of divine mandate, which continues to drive him. This conviction, regardless of its basis in reality, has made him fearless in the face of danger, led him to volunteer for additional tours on the Wall, and motivates him to train obsessively and study Shadowlands lore. This also means he perceives his role not just as a duty, but as a personal calling to serve and protect the Empire.

His premonitory intuition of a disaster striking his homeland has drastically impacted his personal life and further fueled his commitment to his duty. His self-imposed exile from his family and homeland illustrates the depths of his commitment to safeguarding the Empire. It also shows his willingness to make personal sacrifices for the greater good, which has undoubtedly earned him the respect and loyalty of his soldiers.

Furthermore, Tsutomu's belief in the validity of his premonitory dream means that he is constantly on the alert for potential threats to the Empire. His sense of urgency and expectation of an imminent, major conflict likely influences his strategic decisions, making him a vigilant and proactive leader.

In essence, Tsutomu's experiences, whether mundane or supernatural, have cultivated a profound sense of duty, self-sacrifice, and resolve in him, shaping him into a committed, driven, and vigilant leader of the 1st Imperial legion.







With all of that in mind, Tsutomu is not the only member of the 3rd legion who attunes their attention to the tides of fate:

Mirumoto Uta is a samurai merchant who works as a supply sergeant for her battalion in the 3rd Imperial legion.  She is acquiring a reputation as a degenerate gambler, and many believe that if she were not wealthy enough to sustain the frequent losses that all gamblers face, it would put her position and career in jeopardy.  She has explained that she doesn’t gamble for the money or the thrill, but as a form of fortune telling.  It is well known that luck ebbs and flows like the tide, with peaks and troughs like waves on the beach.  By gambling regularly to measure whether her good fortune is waxing or waning, she can choose opportune times to volunteer for missions in the Shadowlands.  Uta attributes her success in goblin battles to this practice.

Of course, many in the legion prefer more traditional prayers and offerings.  Consider the case of Matsu Kiyora:

The second time Kiyora went into the Shadowlands, her raiding party successfully slaughtered a small horde of goblins.  No one was killed, though Kiyora sustained heavy injuries.  She could feel her wounds festering as they journeyed back to the Wall, and by the time they rejoined civilization, Kiyora knew that she had become irrevocably tainted.  The healers told her to wait and see, cautioning her that many rookies become wrongly convinced of their own doom after their first Shadowlands battle, but Kiyora knew the truth.

She awoke the next morning feverish and nauseous.  The clear blue sky seemed tinted and joyless, and the fresh air felt wrong in her lungs.  She fled to the nearby woods, but even walking through the pristine beauty of nature offered no trace of happiness.  Feeling increasingly weak and exhausted, she knelt and drew her wakizashi, contemplating an honorable death in seppuku as the only thing left for her.  Half-delirious, she despaired that even in death the taint would not leave her body, and she wondered what would become of her spirit after it departed its corrupted shell.

Hearing a noise, she looked up to see an unnaturally large wolf not 20 feet from where she knelt.  As it crept towards her, she could see that it was no ordinary animal, and she dropped her wakizashi and prostrated herself, offering her body to the spirit.  She understood at that moment that being consumed by this creature would purify her in death, and the wolf could lead her spirit into Jigoku in payment for her sacrifice.  As the wolf came nearer, she pressed her face to the earth in supplication.  The last thing she remembered was its breath on her neck before she blacked out.

Kiyora awoke some time later, alone and confused.  She remained weak, but felt somehow also rejuvenated.  Though still sick and queasy, her appetite had returned.  As a light breeze wafted through the trees, she felt the beauty of the forest and knew that she had been saved.  Though the taint was still within her, it had been decreased by the spirit wolf such that her body now could fight against it and drive out the rest.  She wept with praise and gratitude, and staggered back to base to tell the others of her miracle.

Though some have wondered whether Kiyora’s tale is merely the fever dream of a hysterical rookie, many soldiers have joined Kiyora in leaving gifts and offerings in the forest and praying to the wolf spirit, asking for the same aid if ever they too should fall to the taint of the Shadowlands.







Here's another legionnaire from the 3rd Imperial legion, Isawa Koichi.  As a bit of background, in my campaigns, the Day of Thunder was different from the canonical L5R storyline, and it involved a cult of Lord Moon trying to stage a coup and take over several of the great clans in order to destroy the authority of the Emperor (who is more aligned with Lady Sun).  Prior to this time, the worship of Lord Moon was much more tolerated, and even afterwards it has not been declared heretical, since the Empire does not wish to declare itself in opposition to the Lord of the Night Sky, lest it suffer the consequences of his displeasure.  However, there are many more restrictions placed on moon worship than there were before (Lord Moon is not a fortune, but rather a celestial entity, if that matters).  With that in mind, here is Koichi's story:

Koichi is a tracker who hunted bandits in the Isawa woodlands before being assigned to the Imperial Legions.  She once tracked a group of bandits into the woods after following the tracks they left from robbing a caravan, but she soon lost their trail.  Reasoning that few bandits actually live in the woods, she took a chance on them returning to their peasant homes that evening.  After darkness fell, she was vindicated as she saw lantern light in the distance through the trees.  Following behind, she tried to draw close enough to avoid losing track of them, but she ended up stumbling upon one of the bandits who had not bothered to light a lantern.

He shouted for his comrades and attacked even as she drew her katana.  Though she managed to dispatch him, she was now wounded and feared she could no longer run as quickly as she needed to escape her pursuers.  As her lungs burned and her wounds bled, she prayed to whatever kami were listening to deliver her from this danger.

Suddenly she found herself stumbling into a small clearing.  The full moon shone overhead far more brightly than she remembered, enveloping her in its radiance and conveying a profound sense of peace and safety.  As she stepped into the center of the clearing, she looked up at the stars and found she could not recognize any constellations.  As she sat down to bandage her wounds, she periodically looked skyward to thank Lord Moon for offering her shelter.  Each time the night sky seemed different, as if the stars themselves were moving either too slowly or too quickly for her to track.

The next morning Koichi returned home safely, and was eventually able to uncover the identities of the surviving bandits.  She recounted her tale and credited Lord Moon’s favor for the arrests, and she began carrying obsidian with her to observe and solicit her good fortune.  She searched the woods for the clearing where she’d accepted sanctuary, but she was unsure whether it was any of the clearings she found, or whether she had even been in this world while taking refuge that night.  She commissioned obsidian figurines to bury in all the clearings in that area, and she burnt incense and prayed her gratitude as she meditated in the forest.

After the Day of Thunder, Koichi found herself looked upon with suspicion.  Lord Moon’s favor had become a mark of ignominy, but she was unwilling to forswear her benefactor.  She declared her undying loyalty to the Empire and swore she would never turn against Lady Sun or support any cult of Lord Moon, but neither could she show herself ungrateful.  After all, while the Emperor had recently declared it heretical to pray to Lord Moon from within any temple consecrated to Lady Sun, he had not forbidden his subjects from praying to Lord Moon in general, lest the Empire suffer the consequences of his displeasure.

Still, Koichi found herself marginalized, and eventually volunteered for the Imperial Legions, as that was the only promotion she found herself able to get.  Unfortunately, her reputation has followed her to the Kaiu Wall, where she has encountered similar hostility and suspicion.  Kuni Yori recently visited to interrogate her, and afterwards assured everyone that her loyalty was not in doubt, though he did say what tests he performed.  Koichi has been ordered to not share any details of their meeting, and she seems haunted by the experience.

Koichi later befriended a well-educated monk named Kouji who was too young to have deep wisdom but who had also struggled against the supernatural and been touched by it.  Though neither was able to answer the most important questions that the other faced, their friendly and collaboration ended up helping both of them navigate both the spiritual challenges and political adversities they each faced.  Kouji helped her to craft a vow to Lord Moon, which she had previously been nervous about swearing, because of the dangers of people thinking it implied disloyalty to the Empire.

Koichi had three requirements for such a vow:
-> she will perform some form of appropriate nightly prayers, which she will perform in the absence of any external light source, illuminated only by moonlight
-> as she was protected in the nighttime, she will protect any who seek her protection, and she will come to aid in any kind of warrior duties which take place at night from any who ask it of her, and she will continue to do this until they release her from those duties, regardless of what clan or family they are from
-> the vow needed to incorporate loyalty to the Empire, and make it clear that neither of the above requirements of the vow may override her loyalty to the Empire, and she may not be forced to ever perform any duty contrary to Imperial law

Kouji was thus able to suggest this wording for Koichi's vow:

"In the sight of all that is, under the timeless gaze of Lord Moon, I, Isawa Koichi, swear a solemn vow.

Each night, when Lord Moon ascends his throne in the celestial heavens, I shall pay homage with earnest prayers and silent reflection, carried out in the purity of his luminous glow. As he once bathed me in his protective light in the heart of the Isawa Woodlands, so too will I embrace his guidance in the quiet of the night, absent of all other light, a testament to our fateful meeting.

Just as I was sheltered by Lord Moon's radiance amidst danger, I too shall extend my protection to those in need. As a warrior and servant of the Empire, to any who seek refuge in the quiet of the night, regardless of clan or family, I will provide aid and stand as their shield, until they see fit to release me from such duties. The cry for assistance in the hush of the night shall not go unanswered, for in me they shall find a vigilant protector, an embodiment of Lord Moon's protective glow.

But let it be known, my devotion to Lord Moon is woven within the fabric of my unwavering loyalty to the Empire. This vow I swear, the promises I make, and the duties I undertake, shall never overshadow nor undermine my fidelity to the Emperor and the Imperial law. My actions shall reflect my honor, my strength, and my commitment to the Empire.

Lord Moon, hear my vow, a testament to our bond and a reflection of my gratitude. May your light guide me in upholding my word, as I navigate the path of honor, service, and loyalty. This I vow, under your watchful eye, and in the service of our glorious Empire."







Here's another story, this one also semi-tragic, about another member of the 3rd legion named Matsu Tonami:

Ever since the first time Tonami saw combat in the Shadowlands, she has been plagued with nightmares about being attacked by Shadowlands creatures.  In her dreams she sees her comrades die around her and feels herself being killed and devoured by monsters until she wakes up shaking or screaming.  She believes she was marked by an oni while in the Shadowlands, which attacks her in the dream realm while she sleeps.  Such things have been known to happen, but it’s extremely rare and such dreams usually stem from a lack of courage.  Many soldiers are granted transfers away from the Wall if they cannot handle the stress and danger.

Tonami knows that such a transfer would mark her forever as a coward, so she resists any suggestion to transfer away.  Instead, she has volunteered for more raids than are required, and has consistently demonstrated unflinching courage in the face of danger.  Some have whispered that she is simply making a show of bravery while being secretly terrified, though others argue that true courage is about overcoming fear rather than feeling unafraid.

Tonami eventually volunteered for a second tour on the Wall, attempting to put to rest any suspicion that her dreams come from cowardice or that she shrinks from danger.  She has taken to camping in the nearby woods where Kiyora was blessed by the wolf spirit, praying for it to also assist in her own struggles against the forces of darkness.  Even if the wolf spirit never answers her prayers, at least she will not disturb her comrades when she wakes up screaming, which has been happening with increasing frequency as she goes on more Shadowlands missions.

Tonami recently solicited aid from the shugenja Kuni Yori, but he refused, saying there was nothing he could do to help her.  He further declined to offer any guidance or even his opinion on the nature of her affliction.  Tonami has wondered aloud about the motives behind this odd refusal.  Such incuriousness is uncharacteristic of the Kuni, and this has made her further convinced that her predicament is strange and supernatural in nature.

(Consider how this story is also ambiguous - a modern reader would be likely to interpret Tonami's affliction as psychological in nature rather than supernatural.  However, in addition to the themes of ambiguity, Tonami's circumstances continue to drive her behavior now.)

A much less sad and unpleasant story is the leadership of lieutenant Shiba Asayo:

Asayo is a courtier who met the customary skepticism that most bushi feel for any courtier assigned to the Wall.  Many feel nervous about going into battle alongside a man who isn’t a warrior, far preferring bushi comrades who are maximally trained in combat.  They were further suspicious of his seemingly foppish nature, as his main interests are playwriting and painting.  However, he has proven himself in battle and in the dojo enough times that no one who has fought against or alongside him has any concern about his worthiness.

Before each mission into the Shadowlands, Asayo paints one half of a painting, then finishes it after his return.  The first half is itself a complete (if spare) work, and the second half fills in details which often change the overall meaning of the piece.  He expects that if he falls in battle against the forces of evil then his final “unfinished” painting shall be quite a collector’s item.  He has gifted some of his finest works to high-ranking officers and visiting officials, and his art has become well regarded, especially since each painting has an associated (though often exaggerated) story from his mission.

As he progresses in mastery of his art, Asayo increasingly finds himself in a sublime and almost trancelike state as he paints, as the process of the great masters has been described.  Just as a swordsman is told to strike with no thought, so too has Asayo begun to create with a clear mind and let the brush move of its own accord.  Eventually he began noticing details in his half-finished works that he does not remember adding, which he recognizes as a sign that he is on the path to becoming one of the transcendent masters.

About a year ago, when returning to finish a painting after a mission, he started noticing details which reminded him of places or objects he encountered while in the Shadowlands.  It’s always subtle, such as an oddly shaped branch or the curve of a rocky stream, but it has now happened enough times that he has begun sharing his unfinished works.  Reactions are mixed, but many have recognized details in his unfinished paintings later appearing in the Shadowlands.  Some of Asayo’s comrades have taken to scrutinizing his half-finished works before they embark on a mission with him, looking for signs and omens.

Here's one more story about a legionnaire from the 3rd Imperial legion:

After being assigned to the Imperial Legions, Kitsuki Fu was first stationed with the 2nd Imperial legion at Beiden Pass.  The legion there is expected to maintain a sizable force in the mountain pass itself, but the soldiers far prefer to spend their time in the nearby city of Ryoko Owari.  People often make arrangements to cover for one another so they can spend extra time in the city, but sometimes due to poor planning or plain irresponsibility people simply fail to report for duty.  Fu was assigned to a squad tasked with recording these absences, tracking down wayward soldiers, and returning them to Beiden Pass for discipline.

One day as Fu set about her usual routine, she found herself with the odd feeling that she was neglecting something important.  She set aside those concerns to focus on the day’s work, but that night she reviewed her journal to check for notes or reminders.  She was shocked to learn that she had been investigating a disappearance of which she had no memory.  Fu asked her colleagues, but none of them could remember anything about it.  She took more notes and wrote down her reactions, then wrapped her journal around her daisho in case she awoke the next morning with another hole in her memory.

Fu woke without forgetting her evening’s work, but found that the pages she had been studying were missing.  Her entry from the previous night was still present, but all other pages from the past week were gone.  Panicked, she began pouring over the legion’s attendance records to see who might be missing, and insisting that her colleagues begin constantly journaling their own activities and reviewing those journals daily.

The next night, Fu found herself in the room of her company captain.  As she came back to herself, she found herself being shaken awake even as she realized she was burning the journal she had convinced him to begin keeping.  It was later discovered that she had also destroyed the attendance records as well as all records of the soldiers currently assigned to the legion.

Fu was terrified, and insisted that some sinister force was at work and anyone could now be in danger, perhaps of being eaten by an oni which consumed even the memories of its victims.  The prospect was frightening (if unlikely), so much work was done to determine whether anyone was missing, and new procedures put in place to detect any such disappearances in the future.  Fu insisted that the measures were laughingly insufficient and became belligerent at any suggestion that she was overreacting.  It was pointed out that the only sign of anything awry was her own behavior, and perhaps she had become possessed by some spirit.

A shugenja was called in, who confirmed she was not currently possessed, though this did not prove she had not been possessed at some time in the past or that she would not again fall victim to possession in the future.  As she became increasingly confrontational and hysterical, she was eventually demoted and transferred to the Wall, where the officers had far more experience keeping an eye on soldiers who might be suffering evil influences.

Fu eventually realized that the only way to see the investigation through was to prove her sanity and level-headedness to her superiors in her current post.  She has stated that she wishes to demonstrate her clear thinking and sharp intellect so that her superiors can write letters of recommendation and send word that this matter should be given more urgency that it has previously received.  Because she had been near the end of her tour of duty, she reenlisted to give herself more time to gain the recommendations she requires.

After the Day of Thunder, Fu felt vindicated and she suspects that Lord Moon’s servants may have had some hand in this matter.  She has gotten word that this investigation has received increased scrutiny after it was revealed that some in the Scorpion clan had fallen under Lord Moon’s influence, but she remains convinced they are not doing enough.  Fu intends to return to Ryoko Owari after this tour of duty to hunt for whatever monster lurks in the shadows there.

In the meantime, Fu keeps a meticulous journal and has developed an obsessive system of indexing its pages, then carving the index into wooden planks she nails to the walls of the barracks.  She reviews the journals regularly and checks for missing pages to ensure that no more of her memories are stolen from her.  Thus far she has had no further missing time, which only confirms that the danger is centered around Ryoko Owari and Beiden Pass.







The 1st Imperial Legion is tasked with guarding the Gateway to the Land of the Burning Sands.  The Emperor’s second son traditionally commands this legion starting at his gempukku, giving him valuable leadership experience while keeping him away from the temptation of entangling alliances with those who might seek to subvert authority of the crown prince.  Located on the western frontier of the Empire, this post ends up being mostly ceremonial since it has been centuries since the last gaijin invasion.

By way of background, this campaign took place 1 year after the end of the Lion/Crane war, which means that tensions are still high between the Lion and Crane clans, and they mostly stay out of each others' ways - a Lion wandering into a Crane clan company encampment might be in serious trouble and could be beated or even killed if conflict occurred and escalated.

One thing I liked to do in this campaign was come up with a lot of stories about people being haunted by ghosts.  For example:

Doji no Tsume Toyohiro distinguished himself in military service during the Lion/Crane war in the northern front. In particular, he commanded a company that repeled a group of tunnelers who were trying to literally undermine the walls of Kyuden Tsume itself. Most of his comrades died, and Toyohiro frequently sees both them and sometimes his opponents as he goes about his day.

Lately he’s taken to following where they lead, listening to what they have to say, and speaking with them. This has frequently taken him into the 6th Battalion (which is the Lion battalion), but the Lion have ultiamtely decided that he is the only Crane allowed to wander freely through their territory, because anyone who struck him down or even interfered with his journey might find themselves haunted by the same ghosts which pull him along. Matsu no Moyu Kazushi visited each Lion company to counsel this policy of non-interference, though he has suffered some mockery from non-Lion companies as a result.

Here's more information about Matsu no Moyu Kazushi's own experiences with ghosts and hauntings, which he denies strenuously:

A former member of Matsu Gohei’s command staff, Kazushi voluntarily took a minor demotion after his association with Gohei became seen so widely as questionable. He decided to serve in the 1st Imperial legion rather than to join the Office of the Crystal Champion, in part because it is not yet clear what that will ultimately entail.

Gohei was branded “the butcher” by his enemies, and decided to take this on as a mark of pride. This was for a number of things, including:

→ Catching scouts and then executing them as peasants even when they claimed to be samurai.

→ Giving samurai executions (i.e. beheadings) to “samurai caught posing as peasants” who may or may not have just been peasants.

→ Running off priests and monks who descended on battlefields after battles had ended to perform death rites to prevent the recently deceased from haunting the battlefields as unhappy ghosts. Occasionally a priest or monk would refuse to leave and Gohei would execute them as Crane spies.

This last example was particularly egregious, but Gohei prides himself on fearing nothing, and especially being unafraid of ghosts, even the vengeful ancestors of his enemies. In particular, he would raid and pillage ancestral shrines in conquored territory, even while others treated them with the same reverence as shrines and temples to the fortunes and kami.

Kazushi participated in many of these raids and executions, and yet was the first person to warn everyone off of attacking Doji no Tsume Toyohiro, saying things like, “Trust me, it’s a bad idea and not worth it to interfere with a man’s ancestors.” Last year during the entire week of the Bon festival, Kazushi enshrined himself in Chai Sedo burning incense and praying to his own ancestors. Evidently he consulted with Toranosuke (the abbot of Chai Sedo) and was told this was a good way to fulfill his own ancestral commitments while remaining safe from vengeful ghosts during the week in which the gates of Jigoku are open.

It’s unclear how Bayushi Iru discovered all of this, since the Lion tend to close ranks and not share internal gossip, and Toranosuke is known for discretion, but Iru is the reason why this is all public knowledge. After a minor public squabble, she called him out as being haunted, using language like “what did that idiot think would happen – he desecrated ancestral shrines so now of course he’s haunted by angry ancestors!” Kazushi challenged her to a duel and was forced to submit by her superior skill. (Iru said nothing disparaging afterwards, but as a person who always complements her opponents after any kind of duel her silence spoke volumes.)

Here's another member of the 1st legion with experience being haunted:

Kakita Korihime is the daughter of Kakita Yariga, who was the executioner to Kakita Toshimo. She took up her father’s role as executioner, but found herself unusually susceptible to hauntings. After performing only a handful of executions, she took a demotion in order to serve as a platoon lieutenant in the 1st Imperial legion.

As far as she knows, all of the vengeful ghosts who were previously haunted her eventually made their way into Jigoku, and she reports no sightings after arriving at Chai Sedo, though she spends a considerable amount of the week of the Bon Festival in the temple.

Korihime has been here for multiple tours and is a likely candidate as the next captain of Kakita company.

And now here's a different story not directly related to a haunting, but more generally about a supernatural torment on the 1st Imperial legion - Otaku Mirai:

Starting the night of his gempukku, Mirai was tormented in dreams by a mujina. This curse followed him to his first assignment as a sergeant in the 1st Imperial legion. At times he would go weeks without being able to sleep through the night.

One evening, an old man appeared in the Mirai’s dreams, identifying himself as the spirit of a neglected sword. Shockingly, the man was a gaijin who named himself Heartseeker. The old man additionally stated that he was unable to leave his scabbard as he had been defiled by dirty human hands. Most importantly, the spirit told Mirai that should he wish to permanently rid himself of the hateful mujina, he should clean the blade of its rust.

Mirai tracked down all of the gaijin swords in the legion, of which there were many, and identified and acquired Heartseeker from captain Otaku Hiyu, who had left it languishing in a crate of old antiques not considered worthy of display. It had originally been taken from a slain gaijin bandit many centuries ago.

Desperate to be able to sleep well again, Mirai carefully cleaned the blade. As he finished his eyes fell upon the decorative leg of a brazier in his room. In the flickering light it suddenly resembled the imp in his dreams! The freshly cleansed sword then moved by itself to lop off that decorative leg, thus freeing Mirai from his nightly torment.

Mirai carries this sword with him at all times, strapped to his back in the manner of a barbarian. When in his tent it occupies a place of honor at a shrine he has built for it back at camp, but he never travels without it. Being a courtier and thus not able to duel, he has taken to practicing with it and has developed his own fighting style. He has spoken of plans to eventually make a warriors pilgrimage to join Moto Gaheris’ army to better learn its techniques and adapt to other more civilized weapons, though many doubt that he will follow through on such plans, as many take this as the boastful talk of a teenager.

Here's another member of the 1st legion with an interesting vow-related experience:

Yasuki Kiyomi’s mother is the Yasuki Deputy Minister of Works. Kiyomi should have followed in his parents’ footsteps, but shortly before his gempukku his mother had a dream in which a divine being told her that her son should become an Imperial legionnaire and take a vow of poverty. The exact divine being is unclear: there were several details in the dream which suggested ether Bishamon (the fortune of Strength), Hachiman (the fortune of Battle), or Chagatai (the fortune of courage).

Kiyomi was therefore assigned to the 1st Imperial legion and was made a platoon lieutenant at 14 (because of his mother’s rank). He hoped that his first tour would be sufficient, but his astrology reading leading up to the end of his tour indicated that he should continue current endeavors and avoid new undertakings or journeys. He is therefore in his 2nd tour and hoping to be able to return home – it’s certainly possible that becoming a legionnaire was intended to be a single step on the journey towards his destiny. Or perhaps he will end up needing to remain a legionnaire for his whole life… or at least until his destiny has been clearly fulfilled.

The reason for the vow of poverty is unclear, and Kiyomi has publicly wondered about whether the vow is legitmate, since it was sworn “to the divine being who appeared to my mother in her dream” rather than naming a fortune or kami by name.







Tsukimichi's backstory:

The nightmares started with my monthly cycles. At first they were vague and clouded, with the occasional flash of gore or horror- sharp snapping teeth, the blood stained tip of a knife. But over time, patterns of images became clear. Until on the night before my gempuku, I found myself at the base of a impossibly steep mountain path leading straight east. The largest full moon I had ever seen was rising over the path as if it led all the way to the moon itself. Light from the moon illuminated the pathway and showed it to be covered in loose scree, some of it quite sharp and already tinged with the blood of previous travelers.  I looked down at my bare feet and despaired of making any headway along that path. But oh how I wanted to. It wasnt that I felt some sort of call to the moon or to adventure. But rather this vicious challenge had been set in front of me and I felt more forlorn than I ever had at even the thought that I might not master it. I could see myself tripping lightly from rock to precariously placed stone on my tiptoes like the most graceful of dancers and I knew in that moment I had to make it happen. So the next day when I passed my challenges and became an adult, I chose the name Tsukimichi or Moon Path for the challenge that had been set before me that I did not understand but had vowed to nevertheless, conquer. 

If I had hoped this would turn some sort of tide with my nightmares, I was disappointed. Images became more fractured, sleep more disjointed.  But I was disciplined.  I was trained as a courtier and demanded perfection from myself in my professional life. I was as skilled at hiding my own weaknesses as I was at exploiting the weaknesses of opponents.  But my haunted mind did not make it easy for me. I presume I began sleepwalking. I would fall asleep in my bed and awaken in strange locations with no memory of having gotten there. Objects would disappear from my rooms and appear in the rooms of professional rivals. Or sometimes vice versa. I started suspected a darker hand at work when those rivals would occasionally sicken at opportune times for my own professional development. Each time, my dreams would clear and I would catch a glimpse of the gleaming mountain moon path, and I would wake with cuts on my feet and bloody gravel in my bed. 

The night everything turned, I awoke from a dream of gnashing teeth to find myself in an alley with a murdered woman. I didn't check who she was but I believe she was yet another professional rival. My hands were clean, but my feet were bloody. I had no memory of getting there. I was wearing my nightclothes and appeared to be unarmed. In my terror I ran for the river. The full moon cast a silvery path across the water and in my panic and hysteria I thought that perhaps all this time I had been destined to follow a different moon path to the end of my days. It would certainly be easier to traverse gracefully.

 I was on the verge of throwing myself into the river and into this new path when a kind stranger named Karinsu laid a hand upon my shoulder and pulled me back. At the time I thought him merely to be a concerned passerby. But it soon became obvious he was much more- perhaps even a boddishatvha- as he explained to me that my life was destined for a different path, in fact many different paths. As he showed me how to nature of truth and life winds around on itself creating a variety of paths of reality which can be traveled singly or together. He showed my the path that would be created if I had never been born, or the path that would be created if I took my own life that night. And then he showed me some of the possible paths the future might take if I were to keep living. He told me to see to my strength and my friends.  And he disappeared.  

A few days later, I was tapped for a diplomatic mission to Toshi Ranbo, which had just fallen to the Crane. The woman who was supposed to lead our contingent had gone out drinking to celebrate her promotion and never returned. It was presumed she had sufficiently shamed herself and was lying low, trying to come up with face saving measures before she rejoined polite society.  To my knowledge,  they never did find her. 

In Toshi Ranbo my dreams and sleepwalking increased. For the first time my professional life suffered. I visited many shrines and temples to pray for a cure. One night I awoke in front of the temple of Bishamon. My head was clear in a way it had not been clear since I was a girl. I immediately threw myself upon the mercy of the monks and asked to join holy orders. I have not had a single nightmare or sleepwalking incident since. 







Another type of ambiguity which exists in this setting is that even when something is plainly supernatural, people will debate it's origin and significance.  For example, here's an open letter written by the head of the Agasha shugenja academy, Agasha Tamori, about why he is banning Kitsu Okura's book "On the relationship between Man and the Fortunes" from all Agasha libraries and recommending that it be banned from other Dragon libraries as well:

The line of Kitsu Okura is unique in all of recorded history.  Only one man in ten thousand is gifted by the kami as a shugenja, and even among the children of shugenja, only one in a century will share the talents of their sire.  Yet in every generation for three centuries, the firstborn son of Kitsu Okura unfailingly becomes a shugenja, each choosing the name of Kitsu Okura at his gempukku.

Okura’s progeny claim ignorance of the source and nature of their blessing.  Remarkably, though each has been a competent practitioner, none have shown any abilities above or below the ordinary.  Without exception, their powers have been plainly average.

Even still, the significance of this anomaly is impossible to understate.  If we could understand and replicate whatever pleased the fortunes so greatly about this family, it would usher in a new era of power and prosperity.  In seeking to uncover this mystery, we must ask ourselves what sets this lineage apart.

Three things are extraordinary about the line of Kitsu Okura.  First, their great scholarship; their progenitor was one of the greatest scholars the Empire has ever known, and every descendant has followed in those footsteps.  Second, their unceasing chain of shugenja fathers and sons.  Lastly their conspicuous lack of any notably powerful shugenja in more than three hundred years.

It would be absurdly coincidental for three different exceptional traits to persist for a dozen generations through unrelated happenstance.  Let us therefore assume these peculiarities are interwoven.  We must then ask ourselves what contrivance would produce these three particular outcomes.

One of the linkages is well explored - it has long been noted that power and scholarship are seldom shared by the same shugenja.  List the twenty most accomplished chroniclers of lore and the twenty most powerful shugenja the Empire has ever known, and not one name appears twice.  The ability to explain plainly a complex truth comes with expertise in any natural discipline, but this is apparently not so with the supernatural.

Indeed, the Shinsei rarely answered any question but with another question.  Such teaching enlightens more than outright explanation possibly could.  Any statement about the Tao is wrong, for the Tao is more complex in every facet than words can describe, and those seeking enlightenment must therefore pursue an understanding beyond language.

It follows that using language to describe the indescribable is an impediment to our mastery of the elements.  It therefore seems prudent to give little weight to writings such as those of Kitsu Okura, lest they encourage counterproductive patterns of thought.  One wonders how much potential has been squandered by young shugenja seeking to learn more of their gifts, being ensnared by wise-seeming words, and unknowingly curbing their own talents as they travel false paths.  Even powerful shugenja who cast aside these distractions might have found even greater power had they not wasted past thoughts and energies on the diversions of false scholars.

If a shugenja reads a book and then fails to achieve their full potential as a direct result, is their lost power simply unattained, or could we say it was stolen by the book’s author?  Perhaps literally so, if my suspicions are correct.

Are we to believe that after three hundred years, the line of Kitsu Okura has not realized that their attempts at scholarship have held them back?  That every powerful shugenja in history only came into their power after they stopped trying to put the nature of their abilities into words?  Why would the line of Kitsu Okura unceasingly refine and develop their scholastic theories for three centuries, when no great shugenja in that time has ever credited them as aiding the development of his own wisdom and power?

At best, the scholastic works of Kitsu Okura are a well intentioned distraction, best avoided by any shugenja with care for his own achievement.  At worst, they are a trap set to drain us of some portion of our power, so that the line of Kitsu Okura may continue.  In either case, I have ordered his texts banned from all Agasha libraries, and recommend that all other great Families do the same.

The above letter emphasizes several themes that I try to capture in many aspects of Rokugan's cosmology, especially the well-accepted tension between wisdom and scholarship.  Truth and understanding, especially of the Fortunes or more generally of the Tao, are too big and complex to put into words, so any attempts to do so fall flat.  Those who spend their lives trying to come up with the right words to use to describe the indescribable impair their own ability to reach true understanding.  Thus, the greatest scholars are often students of the wisest, rather than being the wisest themselves.

Consider the following dialog between Tamori and Isawa Tsuke, the Elemental Master of Fire, in which they disagreed about the implications of Kitsu Okura and his lineage:

"Tsuke-sama," Tamori begins, his eyes stern and serious, "You've heard of Kitsu Okura's works, haven't you?"

Tsuke waves a hand dismissively. "Of course. His 'observations' about man and the fortunes? Idle musings, at best. Barely worth mentioning, certainly not worth banning."

Tamori tightens his grip on the scroll in his hands, a copy of Okura's contentious work. "But isn't that precisely the danger? His musings, as you call them, might seem harmless. But they mislead, they distract."

"Distract from what?" Tsuke retorts, chuckling lightly. "Is your faith so frail, Tamori? Does your understanding of the Tao tremble at the thought of differing perspectives?"

Tamori remains undeterred, shaking his head. "It's not about faith, Tsuke-sama. It's about power, understanding, and mastery over the elements. Okura's words, well-crafted though they are, form a barrier to true understanding. They describe the indescribable, thereby weakening our connection to the kami."

Tsuke raises a skeptical eyebrow. "You believe words on a page can drain our power, Tamori? That's a rather superstitious notion, isn't it? Even for a shugenja."

"Consider Okura's lineage," Tamori counters. "Every firstborn son a shugenja, yet none exceptional in their power, despite their scholarly prowess. They attempt to describe the Tao in words, and their potential is lost. Is that not suspicious?"

Tsuke's laughter is robust, echoing in the chamber. "You think this... this academic malady is some form of... of spiritual vampirism?" He leans forward, smirking. "Tamori, you do have a flair for the dramatic."

"It's not dramatics, Tsuke-sama, it's prudence," Tamori insists, his voice steady. "We must guard against influences that can sway us from the true path of understanding."

Tsuke dismisses this with a wave, leaning back in his seat. "And what is the true path, Tamori? You argue against the written word, yet here we are, surrounded by our great libraries. Should we burn those as well? Our path is diverse, as diverse as the elements we wield."

Tamori bows his head slightly, acknowledging the point. "True, Tsuke-sama. Yet even the greatest river is guided by its banks. Let us not blur those boundaries with such questionable texts."

Tsuke shrugs, seemingly indifferent. "Perhaps. But I, for one, am not afraid of a few 'questionable texts'. If you want to ban them in your libraries, be my guest, Tamori. But do not expect the rest of us to follow your lead."

As Tsuke dismisses him, Tamori merely nods, a determined glint in his eyes.

Note that from a narrative perspective, Agasha Tamori's theory is really cool and interesting, and as a writer/gamemaster it's tempting to say that cool theories are always correct.  But I think it's more rewarding to maintain a lot of the mystery and ambiguity, and in order to do that, it means that a large percentage of cool theories like this need to be true and another large percentage need to be false.  One of the best ways to do that is for the ambiguity to exist in-universe so that characters themselves will have well-founded arguments about them.
