The Emperor is Rank 15, all other samurai have a Rank of 1-14.

House Official            Rank
------------------------------
County Magistrate            5
Deputy Provincial Minister   6
Provincial Minister          7
Governor                     8
Deputy Minister              9
Minister                    10
Councilor                   11
Daimyo                      12

add +1 at Deputy Minister and above for the ruling House of a Family
add +2 at Deputy Minister and above for the ruling House of a Clan
subtract 1-3 from Deputy Ministers for clerks and similar officials
subtract 3 from any official as a base Rank for immediate family members

Other notable officials:
yojimbo to a governor or daimyo
emmisaries to/from neighboring Houses
representative on Imperial chancellary and staff
Family, Clan, and Imperial magistrates and staff
officers in the Imperial legions



Recognition
-----------
at Provincial Minister and below, Recognition has a base of your Rank
at Governor and above, Recognition has a base of Rank + 1
one-per-domain officials (e.g. daimyo, Imperial magistrates) have a base Recognition of their Rank + 2
people whose Rank is determined by an immediate family member have a base of the family member's Recognition - 3
for all positions, the standard deviation is 1.0



PCs spend 1.0 for each point of Rank/Honor
your Recognition starts off equal to half your Rank an has a normal cost
so 6/3 would cost 5
   6/6 would cost 8
   6/9 would cost 11
   4/2 would cost 3
   4/4 would cost 5
   4/6 would cost 7
   


Heraldry roll difficulties:

Base TN | House information
---------------------------
     15   the domain's size and wealth and neighbors
     25   basic history and political/military alliances
     35   top officials (Ministers, Councilors, Governors), major lineages
     45   major officials (Provincial Ministers, County Magistrates), lineage wealth and politics
     55   noteworthy minor officials, sub-branches within lineages, major merchant houses
     65   unremarkable minor officials, relationships between specific extended families
     75   inconspicuous samurai not assigned to any significant post

standard modifiers:
    GMs should assign between a -20 penalty and a +20 bonus based on the level of familiarity with the area and people
    GMs should assign a 5-20 bonus if PCs are able to ask specifically about these people or perform other research in advance


Example: the PCs are traveling and a situation occurs where they want to know about one of the Ministers for the domain:
- they've never been there before, and it doesn't border any domain they've ever visited (-20)
- they knew that it was going to be their destination
- BUT they didn't know that the Minister of Justice was someone they'd specifically be interacting with (+5)
- so their overall penalty is -15, but on-site research could yield additional bonuses
- this makes the base TN for their roll 50, but some on-site research could yield additonal bonuses

failing to meet a TN can still potentially give information at lesser levels,
e.g. if the PCs ask about a County Magistrate and miss the TN, they might still know about his lineage and province
