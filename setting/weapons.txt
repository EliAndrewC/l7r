every town and provincial city has an area of 4000 population on market day

    town => (6 - 2 - 1/3) * (350 + 6 * 75) * 3/10 = 880 coming into town
         => 3/5 * 1200 = 720 who live there
         => so 880 + 720 = 1600 folks potentially interested in entertainment

    provincial city => (6 * 2) * (350 + 6 * 75) * 3/10 = 2880 coming into the city
                    => 3/5 * 3000 = 1800 who live there
                    => so 2880 + 1800 = 4680 folks potentially interested in entertainment

    capital city => (6 * 2) * (350 + 6 * 75) * 3/10 = 2880 coming into the city
                 => 3/5 * 12000 = 7200 folks potentially interested in entertainment

~5% of the entertainment-going population on market day is needed for entertainment security
 -> no bar can have only 1 bouncer




1 country monk per village (800 population, counting the surrounding hamlets)
 - how many births / deaths per year among those 160 families?
    * assume an average peasant lifespan of 40 years(?), ignore infant mortality
    * assume a population which is mostly stable but probably growing somewhat
    * however, assume a greater birth rate than death rate to feed the towns and cities
    * so if we had 1000 births and 800 deaths every 40 years, that would be 25 births and 20 deaths per year
 - so in terms of tracking births and deaths, single abbot can easily service an entire village area
 - presumably, the same is true movement and marriages, which will be even less frequent
 - how frequently are worship services held? (not weekly, though abbots may go into market to preach/interact with peasants)
 - how much conflict mediation does an abbot perform?
 - how much teaching is the abbot responsible for, such as spreading literacy?

1 preceptor per town
 - a town's population is only 50% greater than that of a village w/ hamlets
    * there's added hygiene in a town; more baths, fewer things covered in manure
    * this is offset by the increased population density, which aids the spread of illness
    * so we'll say that a town's birth and death rates are stable; 30 of each per year

 ? monks per city
 - a city's population is 3000, which if stable would be 75 births and deaths per year
    * because of more unmarried laborers and shorter lifespan, let's say 50 births and 100 deaths per year
    * the surrounding 6 counties can potentially feed it 180 per year, so this leaves 130 for the capital

? monks per capital
 - the capital's population is 12000
    * so a stable rate would be 300 births and deaths each year
    * we'll say 200 for births and 500 for deaths
    * so the city needs 300 peasants every year to be stable
    * there are (180 - 50) * 6 = 780 extra peasants
    * this leaves 480 peasants left over even after all of this

1 koku = 40 gallons = 1095 meals
       -> 0.036529680365296802 koku / meal
       -> 0.58447488584474883 cups / meal

1 meal (~400 calories) = 1 "bowl" of rice = 0.6 cups = 1 sen (wholesale price is ~0.91 sen)
1 month worth of meals = 1 "jar" of rice = 50 cups = 9 zeni  (wholesale price ~8.4 zeni)


someone working all day every day could make ~50 shirts per week
if we assume that someone makes 2 sen for each 5 shirts,
then that's 1 koku per year

~500 yards of thread per day w/ a drop spindle
and it takes ~1000 yards for a shirt
so you can get the yarn for a shirt w/ 2 days of work
we'll again assume 1 koku per year

we'll assume 1 - 2 koku for weaving, which is more skilled and requires a loom
a good loom costs 0.5 - 2 koku

* one common job for a laborer would be going around to collect the cloth
    and distribute the money
* one common job for an ashigaru would be to go to town and guard the wagon
    that carries the money (~2 zeni per peasant)

an entry level laborer makes ~3 koku per year
3000 sen / 365 days
         = ~8 sen per day
         / 2 shifts (of 6 hours each)
         = ~4 sen per shift


strongarm jobs: starting at ~4 koku per year

intermediate: 6 koku (~1 year to get to this point)

trusted: 9 koku

inner circle: 15 - 20 koku
