Rokugan is about 1500 miles top-to-bottom and about 1000 miles across, which is
about 1,500,000 square miles.

It has a total population of about 100,000,000 divided into about 350 domains.

Samurai are about 2% of the total population, which is about 2 million people.


The Median Domain:

3,750 square miles of land (a little over 70 miles across if a circle)

250,000 total population, divided up into:
 - the capitol         pop    12,000   (5% of the domain)
 - 6 smaller cities    pop 2000 - 4000 (7% of the domain)
 - 36 large towns      pop  900 - 1500 (18% of the domain)
 - 216 small villages  pop  200 - 500  (31% of the domain)
 - 1296 tiny hamlets   pop   50 - 100  (40% of the domain)

These are stats for the median rather than the mean domain, since the mean is
brought up by several dozen of the largest domains in the empire.


SAMURAI
-------
5,000 samurai in the median domain

3,000 "useful" samurai (not too young or old):
 - ~1000 samurai in the capitol
 - ~250 samurai in each of the ~6 provincial cities
 - ~15 in each of the ~36 towns

samurai are typically ~80% bushi, ~10% courtier, and ~10% merchant


MERCHANT HOUSES
---------------
Merchants exist in towns and cities.  We generally divide merchants
into four categories: very rich, rich, poor, and other.
- There are about 200 immediate families made up of very rich merchants,
    which generally make up 4-10 major Merchant Houses.
- There are about 250 immediate families made up of "rich" merchants,
    these are the owners of successful businesses whose extended families
    have great wealth but are not quite on the same level as a "real"
    merchant house.  These 250 families generally run about 25 - 50
    different businesses.

A domain has about 
(63 * 6 ** 3 + 13.5 * 6 ** 4 + 144 * 6 ** 2) => 36,288 families of farmers
which on average generates 5 koku of tax revenue per family
and 2.5 koku of rent to the landowners (only ~10% of farmers are freeholders)
so there's about 81,648 koku of rent going to the landowners

About 6% of samurai are at least Rank 5, which is about 300 total samurai,
many of whom are from the same immediate family.

So the land is owned as follows:
- 10% by freeholding farmers
- 30% by samurai (which is an average of ~5 koku per samurai, though it's not evenly distributed)
- 40% by large merchant houses (so about three to eight thousand koku per merchant house)
- 20% by individual rich merchants (so about three to six hundred koku per business)



ASHIGARU
--------
One male from every family of farmers with at least two males in the countryside
recieves martial training at least once per month.

This is about 10% of farmers, which means about 8% of the countryside have
martial training.  The ashigaru deemed good enough (at least 50 XP) are allowed
to carry peasant weapons.  So about 2% of farmers are armed and capable of helping
deal with criminals.

In a village with its surrounding hamlets (where there are no samurai), there
are about 80 ashigaru, of which about 15-20 are good enough to be armed.



MONKS
-----
Shrines and monasteries are controlled by the Ministry of Rites, and are organized as follows:
- an acolyte is a monk without an appointed post who works for a monk with a post
- each village district has a Country Monk
- each town has a Preceptor per Order
- each province has an Abbot per Order
- each capitol city has a Grand Abbot per Order



BANDITS
-------
The average domain has about 200 bandits, most of which have a day job but also
commit acts of banditry on the side  These acts include:
 - stealing food or other supplies when no one is around
 - mugging or otherwise shaking down peasants where they live/work
 - acting as a highwayman, robbing people on the road
 - joining with other bandits as a gang to attack caravans

Only bandits who are reasonably strong (over 50 XP) will try anything more bold
than stealing and hoping no one sees them.  This means that there are about 45
bandits per domain that will use or threaten violence.  Of these, about 10 will
be good enough (over 100 XP) to act as highwaymen or lead bandit gangs.

So the average domain has about 1-5 groups of bandits attacking wealthy
travellers/caravans.  These groups usually consist of 4-8 bandits, although
they occasionally grow much larger.

About 10 violent bandits are killed each year per domain, both from casualties
during their attacks and being caught by the authorities.



MAHO-TSUKAI
-----------
A typical coven consists of 3-10 bloodspeakers, usually poor peasants. It's
rare to find bloodspeakers among samurai or wealthy peasants.

Only a small percentage of covens are violent.  These covens are typically led
by a powerful bloodspeaker who previously spread his name violently in the
countryside after reaching Rank 5 and taking on the Jama surname.  Thus, about
one out of every three domains has an active coven kidnapping and murdering
well-known merchants and nobles.

There are about 200 Witch Hunters.  Each Witch Hunter covers about three
domains, with large and important cities/domains getting their own Witch Hunter.

OPEN QUESTION: What are the numbers for wild maho-tsukai out in the countryside?
How many are still around, and how active are they and how many of them developed
their powers independently?



OGRES
-----
Every year hundreds of ogres manage to enter Rokugan by making it over the Kaiu
Wall or through the Burning Sands.  About 1000 ogres live in Crab lands, and
another 1000 have settled into Unicorn, Scorpion, and Crane lands.

Ogres typically hide in the countryside, stealing food and livestock to survive.
They are solitary creatures and travel either alone or in mated pairs with at
most one youngling.  Because they are extremely cunning and fierce fighters,
they're very difficult to catch.

However, about 1% of ogres are man-eaters; these ogres typically seek out strong
human victims to consume.  These ogres are much more dangerous but also much
more easily caught, especially since they prefer to pick targets that look like
capable fighters, believing that they gain the power of their victims.



IMPERIALS
---------
Each domain has an appointed Imperial samurai (and spouse/children if applicable)
acting as an Emerald Magistrate.  They have about ten yoriki (bushi assistants)
from the Imperial Legions with them, who are typically from other clans.  The
magistrate and yoriki live in the domain's capitol but travel to the domain's
other cities when necessary.

When fighting breaks out between neighboring daimyo, the yoriki from nearby
domains may be assembled to assist one side or the other.  Having one or two
hundred extra troops can change the outcome of a battle, and high-ranking
Emerald magistrates are not shy about throwing their weight around.

There are also numerous Imperial legions stationed throughout Rokugan.  We have
not yet established specific numbers and locations for all of them, but the ones
which we've established to exist are:
- the 1st Imperial Legion guards the Gateway to the Land of the Burning Sands
- the 2nd Imperial Legion guards Beiden Pass at the Spine of the World Mountains
- the 3rd Imperial Legion guards the Kaiu Wall
- most of the remaining Imperial Legions are also stationed along the Kaiu Wall



RICE
----
Here are some units:
 - The mu, a unit of area equal to 1/15 hectare
 - The shi, a unit of volume equal to about a bushel, or 155.168 jin of rice
 - The jin, a unit of weight equal to 1.33 lbs
 - The author Patrick read considered 3.33 shi of rice to be enough to feed a
   person for a year.

Rice yields 284.40 jin/mu, and 4.00 shi/mu, in twentieth century Hunan China

284.4 jin/mu * 15 mu/hectare
             * 258.998811 hectares/square_mile
             * 1.33 pounds/jin
             * 2.5 cups/pound
             * 0.0625 gallons/cup
             * 0.025 koku/gallon
             = 3,616 koku per square mile

4 tons/hectare * 2204.62262 pounds/ton
               * 0.003314280067510029 koku/pound
               * 258.998811 hectares/square_mile
               = 3000 koku per square mile

1 koku = 200 pounds

According to an ancient Chinese scholar, one landowner could only manage about
10 mu of rice land on his own - for more land than that, he'd need to rent it
out to tenant farmers.

100 mu was the ideal land size for a household of five. 20-30 mu was more
typical for such a household in crowded metro areas however. A small household,
of 1 to 3 people, could work 0.1-5.0 mu of land. A medium household of 4 or 5
people could work 5.1-19.5 mu A large household of up to 8 or 9 people could
work 20.0-38.5 mu

~40 million hectares of land were farmed in early Ming China. There was a 
population of 65 million people at that time.

15% of Rokugan is arable (~560 square miles per domain,
                          225,000 square miles total)
4% is suitable for rice farming (~152 square miles per domain,
                                 60,000 square miles total)

400 farmers per square mile * ~152 square miles
                            = ~60,800 rice farmers per domain
                            * 400 domains
                            = 24,320,000 rice famers in Rokugan

3000 koku per square mile * ~152 square miles per domain
                          = ~456,000 koku of rice per year per domain
                          * 400 domains
                          = 182,400,000 koku of rice
                          * 1/3 years which have a rice harvest (cycled with soybeans and millet/barley)
                          = 60,800,000 koku worth of rice per year



A county has (144 families per town) + (6 * 63 families per village) + (36 * 13.5 families per hamlet) = 1008 farmer families
A domain has 36 * 1008 = 36288 farming families

A domain has ~250,000 population
Assume ~2 koku worth of food per individual, so:
500000 koku per year / 36266 families = 13.7787 koku per family
We'll round up and say that there's usually a bit of a surplus and say that each family produces ~15 koku per year on average



Even if each "merchant, other" family owned a parcel of land, then that would be
(16.8 * 36) + (90 * 6) + 360 = 1505 parcels
                             / 36288 parcels per domain
                             = 4.27% of the land in the domain

The total number of "merchant, rich" in a domain is
(36 * 2.4) + (6 * 18) + 72 = 266 families

The total number of "merchant, very rich" in a domain is
(6 * 12) + 48 = 120 families

Assuming for the moment that ~5000 parcels are owned by samurai, that leaves
36288 - 1505 - 5000 = 29783 parcels left for the merchant families



(so we're not counting the daimyo, governors, or county magistrates)
2 * 6 * 7 = 84 ministers and deputy ministers for each of the 6 ministries in each of the 7 cities)
6 chancellors on the House council
So this is a total of 90 samurai... if each one is from a different immediate family, then that's 9% of the samurai families



A "parcel" of land is the amount of land worked by a single farming family.
Of the 15 koku produced by that parcel:
 -> the magistrate takes 5 koku in taxes
 -> the merchant takes 2.5 koku in rent
 -> the farmer keeps 7.5 koku (their family needs ~10 koku per year to survive)
