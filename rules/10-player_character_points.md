Player Character Points
=======================

PCs may take advantage of one rule which NPCs cannot; when things are really desperate, players can choose to spend a Player Character Point (PCP).  Here are the possible uses of PCPs:
* You may spend a PCP to reroll any roll.
* When you are out of void points, you may spend a PCP as a void point on any roll on which you can legally spend void points.
* After you see the result of rolling skill knack while you are crippled, you may spend a PCP to reroll 10s for that roll.
* You may spend a PCP to give yourself a single free raise to any roll.

Spending PCPs comes with a cost, however.  The first time you spend a PCP, you lose the next 1 XP that you would have earned.  The second time you lose your next 2 XPs, the third time you lose your next 3 XPs, etc.  This total carries over across characters within the same campaign.
