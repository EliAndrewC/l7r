**Bad Reputation (3):**

Your Recognition is considered 1.0 higher for the purposes of being recognized, but your Rank is considered 1.5 lower to anyone who knows about this reputation.


**Contrary (5):**

You cannot remain a neutral third party in any disagreement; you must actively take a side.


**Dark Secret (6):**

You have done something in the past which is considered disgraceful, and one of the PCs and a small number of NPCs (chosen by the GM) know about it.  Characters who know your secret treat you as if your Rank and Recognition were 6.0 lower.


**Discordant (12):**

You are spiritually unbalanced in a way that affects the harmony of the five elements.  Because of this, you may not spend void points on skills.


**Driven (5):**
You have some ultimate goal which you want to achieve so badly that you'll disregard the adventure goal in order to pursue it.


**Emotional (3):**

You do not exhibit the emotional reserve appropriate to a samurai.  Instead, you are very quick to let your emotions show, which will make some people uncomfortable.  NPCs will tend to not address your character directly and instead talk to other PCs in conversations.


**Humble (2):**

Bragging rolls about your accomplishments are unaffected by this disadvantage, as are the Rank and Recognition bonuses you receive for them.  However, while you may speak well of your accomplishments, you are self-deprecating about your skills and talents.  Rokugan considers humility a vice, or at least an unfortunate eccentricity, so this will be frowned upon by many.


**Jealousy (3):**

You have some skill by which you measure yourself against everyone else.  You must constantly size up everyone you meet to determine roughly how they fare compared to you at this skill.


**Long Temper (5):**

You holds grudges over perceived insults, especially over matters of honor. Although you need not react immediately, you will not forget the insult and will burn with the need to extract payback.


**Meddler (2):**

You want to know everything that's going on and investigate every interesting event around.  Any intriguing goings on simply have to be looked into, no matter how sensitive the issue.


**Permanent Wound (12):**

It takes one fewer serious wound to kill you.  You may not take the Great Destiny advantage.


**Poor (4):**

Divide your Rank in half for the purpose of calculating your stipend.  You may not take the Wealthy advantage, and you may not take this in a campsign in which you do not receive a stipend.


**Proud (2):**

You are a shameless self-promoter who will never be self-deprecating or play down accomplishments.  You will never directly apologize or admit a mistake even when actually at fault.


**Slow Healer (3):**

You do not heal the first night after being wounded, but heal normally after that.


**Short Temper (8):**

You are easily insulted and must react immediately against perceived slights, particularly when they are related to matters of honor.


**Thoughtless (5):**

You don't think before you speak, and sometimes you cross lines you didn't see. People have 4 free raises when using Manipulation on you, and 2 free raises when rolling Manipulation against anyone on your side of an argument.


**Transparent (12):**

You are always considered to have rolled a 5 on sincerity rolls when lying or otherwise concealing information.


**Unconventional (4):**

You have a slightly unusual way of approaching some aspect of bushido which can sometimes make you seem less honorable than you are at first.  Whenever someone uses the discern Honor knack on you, instead of adding 0.5 * (1k1 - 5) to your honor, the GM subtracts the absolute value of that number.  This may not be taken with the Virtue advantage.


**Unkempt (4):**

You are less diligent about cleanliness and grooming than is considered proper.  As a result, some characters will view you as uncivilized or undisciplined, and you get a -10 penalty to all culture rolls.  This may not be taken with Vain.


**Unlucky (8):**

Once per adventure, the GM may apply a -5 penalty to any non-initiative roll.


**Vain (2):**

You clearly care a great deal about your appearance, which to some is unseemly and unmanly.


**Withdrawn (4):**

You are very reserved and only speak when you feel you have something to say, and even then you express it as succinctly as possible without giving much regard to social niceties.  As a result, your etiquette and open sincerity rolls are never considered to be higher than 15.
