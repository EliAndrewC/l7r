Introduction
============

Legend of the Five Rings is an RPG originally put out by Five Rings Publishing Group, a former branch Alderac Entertainment Group that was absorbed by Wizards of the Coast, which also bought TSR (the makers of Dungeons and Dragons), and is itself owned by Hasbro, which sold the rights to L5R, which were repurchased by Alderac, which were later sold to Fantasy Flight Games.

We've never owned or made money from this game; we simply created these house rules because we didn't like the official ones.  We began by taking the original (1st edition) L5R rules and combining them with rules for 7th Sea, another Alderac game.  Because of this, we dubbed our system **L7R**, though these rules are mostly original.  The original books for these games are well worth reading and have good material which any roleplaying group can use.
