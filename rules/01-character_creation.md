Character Creation
------------------

You start with 150 experience points (XPs) with which to create your character.  which you also spend to improve your character.  GMs award more XP after each adventure, and players must keep track of their total Earned XPs.  When your character dies, your next character receives your Earned XPs at character creation.

## The Five Rings

"A Book of Five Rings" is a textbook on swordplay and strategy written in the mid-17th century by swordmaster Miyamoto Musashi.  Your character has five main attributes which are based loosely on the Rings described in this text.  The following descriptions of each Ring begins with excepts from that Ring's section of Musashi's book.

**Air**

> In the Way of strategy, when you have fought many times you will easily be able to appraise the speed and position of the enemy's sword, and having mastery of the Way you will see the weight of his spirit.

Air is reaction.  It represents characters' ability to respond to their environment and adapt to changing circumstances.  Characters use Air for social interaction and to parry.

**Fire**

> In contests of strategy it is bad to be led about by the enemy. You must always be able to lead the enemy about. Obviously the enemy will also be thinking of doing this, but he cannot forestall you if you do not allow him to come out.

Fire is action.  It represents physical speed and agility.  Fire is used to execute attacks and other dexterous actions.


**Earth**

> Also by training you will be able to freely control your own body, conquer men with your body, and with sufficient training you will be able to beat ten men with your spirit. When you have reached this point, will it not mean that you are invincible?

Earth is solidity.  It represents stamina and endurance.  How wounded characters can become is based on Earth.


**Water**

> Whatever your size, do not be misled by the reactions of your own body. With your spirit open and unconstricted, look at things from a high point of view. You must cultivate your wisdom and spirit. Polish your wisdom: learn public justice, distinguish between good and evil, study the Ways of different arts one by one.

Water is flow.  It represents the ability to focus the mind and body; it is the capacity to produce destructive change externally while remaining constant.  Water affects how wounded characters become when taking damage, but is also perceptiveness and memory.


**Void**

> What is called the spirit of the void is where there is nothing. It is not included in man's knowledge. Of course the void is nothingness. By knowing things that exist, you can know that which does not exist. That is the void.

Void is the essence of all things which binds the four elements together.  It represents your inner balance which allows you to direct your own actions and reactions.  Void determines the number of actions a character has per combat round.


Each Ring begins at 2 and may be raised 1 point at a time by spending 5 times the new value of the Ring in XP.  Your School Ring (explained later) starts at 3 instead of 2.  Each Ring's maximum is 5, except for your School Ring, which has a maximum of 6.


## Skills

Your character's skills are divided into basic and advanced.  Every skill begins at 0 and must be raised 1 point at a time, to a maximum of 5.  Raising a basic skill to 1 or 2 costs 2 XPs, and raising it above that costs 3 XPs.  Raising an advanced skill to 1 or 2 costs 4 XPs, and raising it above that costs twice the new value of the skill in XP.

## Rolling Dice

L7R uses exclusively 10-sided dice.  Unless stated otherwise, a die that rolls a 10 is rerolled, and the numbers are added together.  Because this repeats every time the die comes up 10, any single die has a potentially infinite range.

Every skill rolls with its associated Ring, and the higher roll, the better the result.  The two numbers that define a roll are the dice rolled and the dice kept.  The dice rolled is the sum of the skill and Ring being used.  The dice kept equals the Ring only, and this indicates how many of the rolled dice are added together.


## Void Points

Void points are not directly based on the Void Ring; instead, a character's void point maximum equals their lowest Ring.  Unless stated otherwise, you may spend available void points before any roll, though you may never spend more than your lowest Ring on any one roll.  For each void point spent, you roll and keep one additional die.  Your character regains one spent void point after 8 hours of sleep.


## Schools

You pick a school at character creation, which has a School Ring, a special ability, 3 school knacks, and 5 techniques.  All characters possess their school's special ability and begin with their school knacks at 1, which cost the same as advanced skills to raise.  You may never use or raise any school knack which your character doesn't posses.  As mentioned above, each School focuses on a particular Ring, which is raised for free at character creation.

Characters have a Dan equal to the value of their lowest school knack, so your character may begin as high as Third Dan.  Every school goes up to Fifth Dan, and each Dan grants a technique.


## Advantages and Disadvantages
W
 e provide rules to represent miscellaneous physical traits, noteworthy mental characteristics, and relevant background information.  Advantages help you while disadvantages make things harder, and you choose which ones to take during character creation.  Every advantage has a certain benefit and XP cost, while each disadvantage has a specific penalty and gives you XPs.


## Honor, Recognition, and Rank

Someone's Honor is internal and subjective; it represents the strength of their convictions, whatever they may be.  On the other hand, Recognition and Rank are external and normative; they represent characters' fame and official positions, respectively.  Of course, holding a high position automatically makes you somewhat well known, and most characters' Recognition will be within a few points of their Rank.

Your Honor starts at 1.0 and may be raised as high as 5.0 at character creation.  1 XP will add 0.5 to your Honor score.

Rank varies by campaign.  By default your Rank starts at 1.0 and can be raised with the same cost as Honor at character creation, though some campaigns will have different defaults and limits regarding Rank.

Your Recognition starts at your Rank and may be raised as high as 150% of your Rank at a cost of 1 XP per 1.0 Recognition.  You may choose to cut your starting Recognition in half to gain an additional 3 XPs.

You'll be considered more trustworthy when you have high honor.  Several schools (most notably the Courtier and Merchant schools) have a school knack that lets them discern your Honor, and important people such as daimyo have advisors with these schools who report on how honorable you seem to be.  Honor also gives a bonus to several skills.

You'll be seen as more competent when you have high Recognition.  Since it represents your past performance and accomplishments, people will be willing to depend on your abilities.  They'll also tend to consider you more reliable when you make arguments due to the weight of your experiences.

You'll be granted more authority and taken more seriously when you have high Rank.  Characters with high Rank can more easily ignore insults, challenges, and demands made by those of lower station.  Conversely, you'll be more often allowed to speak and act on behalf of important people when your Rank is high.

Rank also determines your stipend (in normal campains where you're playing a samurai character).  While it's always assumed that you have money for food and other supplies, it can also be useful to spend money on gifts, bribes, etc.  Your yearly stipend is equal to your Rank squared.  You are generally assumed to have around 0.5 + 10% of your stipend in koku on hand.
