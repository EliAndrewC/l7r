Professions
===========

Most non-samurai NPCs don't have a School and instead acquire abilities relating to the work that they do.  Here are the rules for playing non-samurai characters with professions instead of schools:

* Most characters with professions start with their Rings at 1 instead of 2, though this might vary by campaign.  It certainly applies to peasant farmers, though some more privileged backgrounds may start with their Rings at 2, such as those raised as the children of wealthy peasant merchants.
* Characters with professions do not raise a Ring for free at character creation because they have no School Ring.
* Characters with professions have their attack and parry knacks start at 0 instead of 1.
* Characters with professions start with 1 profession ability and gain an additional profession ability for every 15XP earned.  Each ability may be taken from any of the non-ninja ability lists below; the ninja list is reserved for ninja only.
* Each profession ability may be taken twice, except for the Priest profession whose rituals may only be taken once.


== Wave Man Abilities

* When you make an attack roll that would miss, raise it by 5.  Any parry attempt against an attack that receives a free raise in this manner automatically succeeds.
* Raise the TN of someone trying to parry one of your attacks by 5.
* When using a weapon that deals less than 4k2 damage, add an extra rolled damage die to the weapon's base damage, to a maximum of 4k2 base damage.  Also, subtract 2 from your armor damage reduction penalty.
* Round your damage rolls up to the nearest multiple of 5.  If the roll is already a multiple of 5, then raise it by 3.
* You may reroll 10s on a single die when crippled.
* Roll one extra unkept die on initiative.
* Roll two extra unkept dice on wound checks.
* When someone is keeping at least one extra die of damage from exceeding their attack roll TN, subtract 5 from the damage.
* When someone unsuccessfully tries to parry an attack, you may roll 2 of the extra damage dice that you would have rolled had they not attempted to parry.
* Raise the TN of someone making a wound check from damage you dealt to them by 5.  If they fail they take serious wounds as if the TN had not been raised.
