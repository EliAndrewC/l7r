## Brotherhood of Shinsei Monk School

Since before the dawn of history, pious men and women have banded
together to walk the path of enlightenment. They live with one foot
in the world and the other outside it, learning to act according to
the Tao, which is the way of all things. Long before the Great
Ancestors brought civilization to the world, they defended their
fellow man from the cruel and brutal warlords of that age. The
Hantei perceived the special place occupied by those who take up
such a life, designating them outside the Celestial Order which
defines society; monks in the Brotherhood are neither people nor
half-people nor non-people, but are instead a category of their
own. To this day the braver of them continue to protect the
peasantry from thieves and bandits, but braver still are those 
willing to stand up to their samurai rulers and challenge those 
among them who fail to act righteously.

## Courtier School

Within each Clan are several great Families, each of which is
divided into noble Houses, each of which contains numerous proud 
lineages which serve their daimyo by filling hundreds of government
positions. Personal relationships are the glue that hold this
system together, which would collapse without constant
communication and cooperation. Many samurai therefore serve by 
taking up the pen instead of the katana, whether in a government 
post or simply in keeping their own lineage informed and 
well-connected. However, most courtiers still take seriously their 
duties as samurai (“those who make war”), and train hard to be 
capable of defending their domain with the wakizashi when the pen 
fails.
