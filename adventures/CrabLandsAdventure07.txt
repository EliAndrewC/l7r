TIMELINE OF EVENTS
---------------------------
30 days ago ->
    The Nagayumi daimyo authorizes his men to dam a stream which runs from his domain into the neighboring Nishino domain.  Doing so provides his domain's fields with extra water while depriving the Nishino fields of water which they sorely need.  Only a few villages are affected by this, but the Nishino are enraged and demand that this action cease, but the Nagayumi is a larger domain with more troops and feels they are safe from retaliation.

28 days ago ->
    Hida Goro, the Nishino general, proposes an immediate stike, before the Nagayumi have time to assemble.  He argues that it's clear that they don't expect to have to go to war and thus will be caught unprepared.  His daimyo gives him permission and he gathers every available man and makes an incredibly risky but well planned strike at Gifu, the closest Nagayumi city.  He successfully takes the city and renames it Shouri city.  Goro is appointed governor of the city as a reward for his victory.

22 days ago ->
    After almost a week of military engagements, the two domains declare a tentative truce.  The Nagayumi were unable to retake their city, but managed to prevent the Nishino from making any more progress into their lands.  Goro is willing to declare the matter settled, feeling that the insult has been repaid; the Nagayumi are still trying to decide whether to launch a more substantive invasion.

20 days ago ->
    The conquered territory contains a large forest, and Goro immediately conscripts several hundred peasants to work in logging camps to extract lumber as quickly as possible.  He needs some of it to shore up the city's defenses, but is also transporting massive quantities back into Nishino lands; in case they lose this territory he wants to extract as much profit as possible.
    Similarly, Goro does the customary thing with city property and confiscates all the homes and most of the money and valuables.  Wealthy merchants are stripped of most of their possessions, and he gives their manors to his most deserving men to reward their courage and loyalty.  Most of the actual money and liquid assets are transported back into the Nishino domain as a gift to his daimyo, both to show his devotion to his lord and to ensure that they will have profited even if the city is retaken.
    Most of the laboring class of the city is conscripted to shore of the city's defenses and repair the damage done during the invasion.  Merchants are allowed to use what money they have left to buy or rent new homes (or buy back their familial homes in some cases).  Merchants with businesses which are vital to the city's welfare have much less confiscated; for example, general stores are essential and thus allowed to continue to operate.
    Of course, owning farmland is one of the most profitable things a merchant can do, and this is all confiscated as well, but merchants are allowed to purchase back their land.  This is often done on credit, since the merchants have already had most of their lands confiscated, but the families which owned this land originally can basically pay much higher taxes for a number of years in exchange for getting to remain landlords.  The same goes for tenement buildings inside the city.

13 days ago ->
    There are 6 general stores in the city.  Four of them are run by a local family: the Aito, which also sells clothing and medicine.  The other two are mostly groceries, and are run by a family based in a remote city, the Fusao.  Immediately after the invasion, the Aito offered to buy the remaining general stores from the Fusao for a paltry amount, and the Fusao refused.  During the night, the Aito send some of their ninja to the Fusao store where to kill them and their their guards and rob the store.
    After the murders and robbery, the other two stores are forced to close, so Goro confiscates them.  Aito buys them from the governor, who agrees to sell them so that they will remain open and functioning.

12 days ago ->
    The chief of security, who was guarding the other Fusao store the night of the attack, is a man named Junsaku.  He publicly accuses the Aito of murdering the Fusao merchants to take over their stores, but because he cannot prove anything, nothing comes of this.  Junsaku makes several threatening comments during this confrontation, but otherwise the incident ends peacefully.

9 days ago->
    Junsaku gets into an altercation with some of the Nishino troops.  A bushi sees one of his sisters and makes a crude comment and gesture pertaining to her breasts.  Junsaku leaps onto the man and pummels him senseless, knocking out several of the man's teeth.  His friends drag Junsaku off of the man and haul him in front of Goro to be sentenced for him crime.  Goro instead orders Junsaku released and congratulates him for standing up for his sister, ordering his men to let this matter drop.

7 days ago ->
    When Goro conscripted peasants from the countryside, he ended up conscripting 11 of the men from the nearby ninja village.  To free their family members, the ninja who were in the city working for Aito leave and attack two of the logging camps, murdering the samurai and peasant guards working there and freeing all of the peasants.  The peasants are led by a circuitous route through the forest and back into Nagayumi lands, where they'll be safe and un-conscripted.
    The Nishino are furious and accuse the Nagayumi of raiding their logging camps.  The Nagayumi deny everything and claim they would never perpetrate such a dishonorable act (the throats of many of the guards were cut in their sleep, which is not how a samurai would conduct such an attack).

1 day ago ->
    During the night, Hajime (the son of Aito) is attacked as he's sleeping in one of the general stores.  His many guards are killed, and he was severely beaten before being killed.  Before dying, he gave up the location of the nearby ninja hamlet.  That same night, the hamlet was attacked and burned.


ACCOUNTING FOR THE NINJA
-------------------------------------
 - By this time, the ninja who had been sent to Ryoko Owari have discovered that their homes are being attacked and have returned home to guard their families.

 - Most ninja were in the hamlet during the invasion; 11 of the males were conscripted to work in the logging camps.

 - Several of the ninja were in the city; to avoid having them conscripted, the Aito family put them to work in the general stores and had them commit the murders against the Fusao family.

 - The ninja in the city eventually sprung their families in the general store, then returned home to the hamlets where they'd be safe, reasoning that the conscription was over and that they didn't want to be in the city following those murders in case the Aito family came under scrutiny.

 - The attack happened before their family members could return home; although they knew about the danger of an attack, they were undermanned and still were all/mostly killed.

 - The ninja from the logging camp have returned to the city to work for the Aito family; they don't want to work in the general stores themselves because that's too high-profile, so they're working on transporting supplies to the general stores from out of the city.


WHAT THE PCS CAN FIGURE OUT
------------------------------------------
 - The Aito family owned 4 of the city's 6 general stores before the invasion and now they own all of them.  They sell not only food and household supplies, but also medicine and clothing.  Saavy PCs will realize that apothecaries can also deal in opium, and might be able to prove that the Aito are also opium dealers.

 - For a little over a week after the invasion, the Aito had about half a dozen men working in their general stores who they claimed were family members but who no one in the city recognized and who prompty disappeared and have not been seen since.  The PCs will have to do some serious legwork to find this out, but if they do then the Aito will have no good explanation for it (they'll claim it was some cousins who left the city after worrying about getting murdered, but this could be disproven with not much effort).  Eventually they'd confess to sheltering some peasants from getting conscripted.

 - If the PCs start to squeeze the Aito, then they'll have their remaining ninja dress as Hida bushi and try to kill the PCs.  By interrogating the other peasants from the logging camps, the PCs could determine that their attackers were also peasants who escaped after the logging camp attacks.  It's theoretically possible that they could prove that these men also worked for the Aito transporting supplies, but this would be extraordinarily difficult and almost certainly won't happen.
