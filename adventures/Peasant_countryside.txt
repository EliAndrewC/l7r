COUNTRYSIDE HOOKS
-----------------
These hooks take place out in the countryside, mostly in the hamlet / village district where the PCs live.

A feud exists between two peasant families, which has led to vandalism. The PCs are asked to intervene; they can lay down threats, they can report the matter to the magistrates (either honestly or with false testimony), they can stake out the property to try to catch the vandals in the act (very time-consuming and hard on the PCs both physically and monetarily).

Someone comes back from labor and kills someone for being with his wife in his absence. Everyone knows that he did this, although no one actually saw him do it. It doesn't get reported to the magistrate, although the monk and village headsman do know. The PCs must decide whether to tell him about the matter.

The local apothecary asks the PCs to collect some money that he's owed, with the caveat that they do so fairly and not collect from anyone who can't afford to pay. The PCs get to keep half of whatever they collect, and they have total discretion about when to collect and when to give the debtor a break. Several cases:
- folks who genuinely can't afford to pay
- folks who are borderline but have been going out drinking and thus are generally assumed to be able to pay
- someone who has basically no money at all, but who constantly fritters their money away
- someone who donated lots of money to the local country monk and now can't pay as a result
