Doji Hirota is a lieutenant under Doji Kanroku.  He is smart, capable, extraordinarily corrupt, and has a knack for inspiring loyalty in the men under him.  Because he is an extremely effective administrator, he serves as Doji Kanroku's karo, and he is the one who actually performs most of the logistical duties for the district.

The first large event of the campaign is a meet-and-greet party thrown at Doji Hirota's manor.  He has a large house within the city, significantly larger than the home of his captain, Doji Kanroku.  While Kanroku could certainly afford a higher standard of living, being the 6th son of Doji Kuwanen, he instead has a small home next to one of the district barracks, where he can remain close to his men both physically and symbolically.

At the gathering, Kanroku and Hirota will approach the PCs to inform them of a troubling matter.  Apparently there are rumors of corrupt magistrates in the district, who are either looking the other way when they see crimes or even possibly participating in muggings and shakedowns.  Kanroku is forming an elite squad of investigators to look into the matter, and because the PCs have expanded jurisdiction in the city, Kanroku and Hirota promise to keep them well informed.  The PCs will even be asked whether they want to be involved in the investigation, e.g. whether they want to be present when any major suspects are interrogated.  This offer is mainly intended as an inoculation against the PCs learning of these rumors on their own and taking offense at not having been told.

In fact, Doji Hirota and several dozen of the sergeants, corporals, and enlisted bushi under his command have banded together in an extensive criminal conspiracy.  There are several elements to the conspiracy:

1) When the city was first taken, much private property was seized and sold, either to incoming samurai and merchants or even sometimes back to its original owners.  Hirota and his men took advantage of this in several ways:

 - Many of the residency records were lost or destroyed when the city was taken by the Tsume.  As these records for this district were being assembled by the Tsume, Hirota stole many of them and claimed that they were never found.

 - Because local monks are responsible for tracking citizens in their area of influence, Hirota had the abbot for the largest neighborhood in the district framed and exiled from the city for sheltering peasants from conscription.  He then moves the abbot of the second largest neighborhood in to replace that abbot, and has the second abbot replaced by someone from still another neighborhood.  Thus, none of the abbots have longstanding ties to their communities, nor do they know the history and properties in their new areas.

 - Hirota forced out many peasants who were NOT slated to have their property seized, and distributed their properties amongst his men.  He also told many other peasants whose homes were not slated to be seized that they needed to pay a fee or they'd have their property taken; Hirota then kept and distributed this money amongst his men.

 - Hirota's own home was not actually bought legitimately; a large ex-Damasu merchant family bought the home with money they raised from their out-of-town relatives.  Hirota then had this family killed and took the home for himself, claiming that he was the one who bought it; because Hirota comes from a wealthy lineage, no one questioned that he would have purchased such an opulent manor.


2) The corrupt magistrates take kickbacks from the local criminals in exchange for looking the other way on illegal activities like smuggling, opium trafficking, and prostitution.


3) The magistrates shake down local businesses and extort "gifts" from them.  They don't directly threaten or attack merchants who don't comply; instead they'll arrange to have one of their criminal cohorts do something against the business, then make a point of observing the crime and failing to intervene.  This is something which Hirota has only recently begun, and it's the cause of the rumors.


Although there are many ways that the PCs could uncover Hirota's crimes, probably leading to an unexpected combat and subsequent arrests, they will have to really push to do so.  Kanroku has no idea about the conspiracy, but he trusts Hirota completely, and he'll be extremely offended at any perceived disrespect from the PCs.  This includes accusations against Hirota without overwhelming proof, as well as pushing to direct investigations and thus imply that Kanroku's men are incompetent.  So while there is plenty of evidence against Hirota and many who can testify against him, uncovering them will require either great forcefulness or great subterfuge.
