When the Tsume first conquered Toshi Ranbo, they were extremely harsh towards the populace, having confiscated almost all property in the city, declared martial law, etc. They also invited a Witch Hunter to take up permanent residence in the city, as well as several more Witch Hunters to come visit to help purge the city of bloodspeakers. Every peasant in the city was "inspected", heimen and hinnen alike, and several bloodspeaker covens were found and dispatched.

Word of this spread quickly, and several powerful bloodspeakers from elsewhere noted the new lack of bloodspeakers in the city with interest, though most decided to wait until things had settled down before moving in. However, one bloodspeaker named Jama Manabu did move into the area, settling down for awhile into Hikobayashi county in the countryside close to Toshi Ranbo. Many of the peasants were extremely put out with the Tsume, who had confiscated all of property in the countryside as well, including land owned by freeholding farmers, most of whom had toiled for generations to save up to buy their own land.

Manabu quickly gathered a coven, and was canny enough to migrate his followers further away from the city to make it harder to track them down once incidents started happening. He fueled their resentment and hatred towards the Tsume, focusing first on the new magistrate of Hikobayashi (Doji no Tsume Horobinu). Manabu's first open move will be to send an oni to kidnap the magistrate so that his coven can steal his name.

There are several things that the GM can do with all of this:

- The magistrate might be killed, thus giving the PCs an opportunity to select a replacement, possibly from the ranks of their district captains. They may have already done this if they decided to replace Horobinu.

- Depending on how they decided to treat the Nightingale bushi, they might help the PCs track down Manabu, since they'd be able to identify who was disgruntled and left the county recently.

- If the PCs sentenced Mighty Kyoude to being an unpaid bandit hunter as his punishment, he could have been present during the oni attack, probably being the one who killed the oni and thwarted the attack if so.

The witch hunters will follow standard operating procedure after the attack; the PCs and the governor will be told the true name of Jama Manabu, but then each will be told a different name to tell their own underlings. Each is instructed to only tell high-ranking underlings and to tell THEM to keep it secret, but it's expected that the names will leak out. However, it will generally be the WRONG names, and those who seek out this knowledge will not know which name is real, and thus their fear towards Manabu will be much less tied to Manabu's real name, denying him most of the Recognition (and thus power) that he would otherwise gain from such an attack. 




Manabu will eventually learn about Matsu Hiroru and his gang of ninja once he starts venturing into the city and scrutinizing the noteworthy community members. Merchants such as "Uhiro" are prime targets, being well-known enough have worthwhile names, while being not so rich and powerful as to have overwhelming defenses. Manabu won't know exactly who Uhiro is, but he will realize that anyone put in charge of such a mission must be extremely high ranking, and thus have an extremely worthwhile name.

Exactly how much Manabu is able to learn about Hiroru depends on whether any of the PCs let the servant of Lord Moon into the city (http://fatman3rd.proboards.com/index.cgi?action=display&board=rings&thread=936&page=1#5142). If so, then this servant will strike a bargain with Manabu and help provide information about Hiroru's operation. This will make Manabu's job much easier, as he'll be able to identify exactly where and when and whom to strike.

Manabu will start picking off Hiroru's men and then escalate. Here's what he'll do:

- He'll note the most recent of Hiroru's men to die from natural causes, and later take credit for that, claiming to have struck the man dead through illness.

- He'll poison 2 of Hiroru's men some time later, in a manner which is consistent with "natural" but severe food poisoning.

- After another week or two, he'll poison 3 more of Hiroru's men, this time in a somewhat more obvious manner. This is the point at which he'll contact Hiroru, explaining what's happening. (See below for more details.)

- After another week or two, he'll attack 4 of Hiroru's men at night while they're asleep. They'll put up quite a fight, but Manabu will come prepared with a Furry but powerful oni. Afterward, he'll leave opium-making materials around to make it look like a gang attack.

- After another week or two, he'll send several more oni to attack 5 of Hiroru's men at night, this time openly. At this point the ninja will be on their guard and have someone awake to stand watch at all times, but it won't be enough to save them,

- After another week or two, he'll set fire to an apartment where 6 of Hiroru's ninja are living together in the basement; a large blob-like oni will clog the stairwell, trapping them inside to die in the fire. This oni would not have been powerful enough to prevail against so many ninja who are now banding together in larger groups (Manabu does not have an infinite supply of them after all), but it was George Washington enough to keep them from escaping while the apartment burned.

Manabu sends a letter to Hiroru after poisoning 3 of his men. His offer is simple; if Hiroru does not surrender his name, Manabu will continue killing his men, thus thwarting his plans. If Hiroru does surrender his name, Manabu will help him by targeting powerful Tsume within the city, thus undermining the Crane's ability to keep the city when the Lion attack. In particular, Manabu will kill Doji Chuto, the general of the northern armies of the Doji who took and later held the city, as well as several of the most powerful duelists in the city.





After the attack that kills 4 of Hiroru's men, Manabu sends another letter bragging and taunting Hiroru. He says that he enjoyed meeting Hiroru at his shop, and looked forward to seeing him there again in the following week. Although Hiroru knows that Manabu might be lying (which he is), he can't take that chance. So Hiroru does something which he knows Manabu will never expect; he goes straight to the city Witch Hunter, Kuni Ikio. Although he doesn't reveal his real name, he does explain that he's a Lion samurai sent to undermine the defenses of the city, and tells Ikio everything about what's happened with Manabu.

Ikio cares only about catching bloodspeakers, and thus is honor bound to keep Hiroru's secret. He has Hiroru write the names of everyone who comes into his shop for the next week and has men follow anyone who wasn't recognized. After the end of the week, Ikio will take the final list of names and come to the PCs. He'll explain that he has reason to believe that a bloodspeaker is on this list, but he can't explain how the list was compiled. He wants the PCs to help him get the local authorities to agree to round up everyone on the list to be "inspected". This won't turn up any results, since Manabu was lying.

The PCs may attempt to figure out what these peasants have in common, but this will be difficult (though not impossible). Hiroru runs a general store frequented by many peasants from all over the district, and there are hundreds of names on that list, and there are probably other things that most of them have in common. Besides which, Kuni Ikio will object if the PCs attempt to uncover the source of his list of names. 




After the attack which kills 5 of Matsu Hiroru's men, Manabu will send another letter, congratulating Hiroru for the unexpected move of running to a Witch Hunter. He brags about having stared Ikio right in the eyes while tied up and beaten the pathetic Witch Hunter's sad attempt to discover him. He further explains that he enjoyed speaking with Hiroru's 5 men at the neighborhood bathhouse the afternoon before he killed them. This is all lies, and while Hiroru and Ikio know that this might be the case, they can't risk letting Manabu get away.

Thus, Ikio will approach the PCs and explain that he has reason to believe that the victims of this attack met Manabu at the neighborhood bathhouse, though once again he can't explain why or how. He wants the PCs to get the city government to round up everyone who visited the bathhouse that day for inspection, these inspections to take place at Ikio's estate. Hiroru himself will be hidden and looking through a slit in the wall at everyone who's been rounded up, to see whether he recognizes any of them (the bathhouse being in a different district, and thus anyone recognized by Hiroru would be highly suspicious).

The PCs will be able to find out afterward about the mystery individual looking through a slit in the wall, as will the city government. This suggests that the Witch Hunters have some kind of witness who has seen Manabu, but Ikio will refuse to say anything one way or the other.

It's possible, depending on the makeup of the group, how they've behaved towards Ikio, and how trustworthy and honorable he perceives them to be, that he may confide in one or more PCs. He will do this only if he believes that they will keep Hiroru's secret and are interested only in catching Manabu and have no conflicting loyalty towards keeping the Tsume safe against the Lion. Even still, he will probably not reveal what he knows this early, but that really depends on the PCs. 



The prevailing theory in the city government about the bizarre actions of the Witch Hunters is as follows: it's known that Witch Hunters care about hunting bloodspeakers than about enforcing local (or even sometimes Imperial) laws. There are many cases in history where criminals have learned something about a bloodspeaker and then gone to a Witch Hunter to let them know, even confessing their crimes in the process. Witch Hunters are trained to ignore and sometimes even pardon these crimes when they encounter them.

Thus, the city government believes that the Witch Hunters have stumbled upon some criminal organization, such as a gang which has unbeknownst to the city managed to spread across multiple districts. And while the city government was initially willing to go along with whatever he witch hunters asked, their stunning lack of success thus far has led officials to question whether they should continue cooperating. In particular, if the Witch Hunters are as helpless to catch this bloodspeaker as they appear, then perhaps it's worth finding out where they're getting this mysterious information.

Thus, the city will have a pair of bushi dress in nondescript clothes without their daisho (!) and follow Kuni Ikio to note where he goes and to whom he speaks. However, Ikio spots them and doubles back through an alleyway and attacks them from behind, killing one immediately and taking the other alive, who confesses to his true purpose once it is clear that his mission has already failed. The man who was killed is the cousin of Doji no Tsume Koreshiba, the governor's yojimbo.

Various people want the following things:

- The governor wants the PCs to censure Kuni Ikio for his cowardly attack, stabbing someone in the back as he did. Ikio argues that killing a pursuer and taking the other alive was exactly what someone in his position should do, especially since he had to way of knowing whether they were bloodspeakers or even working for Jama Manabu.

- Kuni Ikio wants the PCs to order the city government to stop pursuing information about Kuni Ikio's sources, stop following him, and simple continue cooperating with him.

- Tsume Koreshiba wants to challenge Ikio to a duel over the murder of his cousin. The governor does NOT want him to do this, but might not feel in a position to stop him since it's arguably a legitimate challenge over a matter of honor. The PCs can influence this one way or the other, either declaring that such a challenge is legitimate and pressuring Ikio to respond, or declaring publicly that Ikio acted properly and in accordance with his duties as a Witch Hunter.

It's entirely possible for Ikio to end up dead or exiled from the city as a result of this incident if the PCs don't back him strongly. 




Assuming that neither Jama Manabu nor Matsu Hiroru are caught, one of two things will happen:

1) If Kuni Ikio is expelled from the city and/or leaves due to frustration at being blocked by the city government, then Matsu Hiroru will agree to Manabu's deal and give his name in exchange for help.

2) If Kuni Ikio remains, then Matsu Hiroru will strike a new deal, in which he and his men will perform acts designed to spread Manabu's name without surrendering his own.

Because the PCs have influence over the city, they will largely be responsible for which if these two options happen, and they can prevent both in the unlikely event that they uncover one of these two characters.

Hiroru's men will mostly perform acts of vandalism throughout the city at night, e.g.
- hanging a banner containing the name of Jama Manabu on the gates of the temple
- painting Manabu's name onto walls throughout the city
- leaving flyers written in red ink (to make them look more like blood) throughout the city

This all makes it look as if Manabu has a large coven or even several covens living in the city, but of course none of Hiroru's men carry the Shadowlands taint, and thus cannot be detected by Witch Hunters or shugenja.

Manabu himself will launch one or more attacks designed to take out the samurai most important in the city. The first attack will be against Doji Chuuto, and the next will be against the governor's yojimbo. These attacks will be extremely hard to trace back to their sources, though it is theoretically possible.

Hiroru may also make a deal with the servant of Lord Moon, assuming that one of the PCs have let him into the city. This alliance may allow him to turn on Manabu, possibly by sending the PCs information as to Manabu's whereabouts.

If the PCs do not uncover Hiroru's conspiracy, then the Lion will attack the city again and Hiroru's men will open the gates of the city for them, which basically hands them the battle. There will be little that the PCs can do at this point, though theoretically the Prince could declare the Lion gate-opening to be invalid and order them to withdraw. Since the Lion swear fealty both to their daimyo and also directly to the Emperor, it's very conceivable that they would obey this order. However, the Prince will not give this order, as his father wishes for the Lion to re-take the city. It is theoretically possible for the PCs to convince him, or possibly to fake such an order, or even possibly to coerce him into it. Alternatively, they could intervene to negotiate terms of surrender if the city government can be convinced to surrender, possibly making sure that NPCs of their choice make it out of the city alive.

If this does happen, then it's definitely the end of the campaign, and indeed it is how our run of this campaign ended, though it was a bit more complicated due to one of the PCs striking a number of deals with the servant of Lord Moon.
