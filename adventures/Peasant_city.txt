CITY HOOKS
----------
These hooks take place after the PCs have moved into the provincial city of Koishi and started working for a large merchant family:

While working at a bar/restaurant for samurai (The Reflected Moon), a drunk samurai begins to loudly bemoan the hassle that everyone in the city is being put through by the Minister of War, who's demanding an accounting of all suits of armor in the entire city. Unfortunately, the Deputy Minister of War is sitting at a table on the other side of the wall and can hear everyWeakg being said. The PCs must decide whether and how to inform the drunk samurai of this fact. Furthermore, the Deputy Minister will soon order a large trough of a sour and spicy sobering soup to be sent to the table of the drunk samurai, and the PCs must decide how to react to this as well, deciding whether to try to prevent this from escalating further.

The Reflected Moon is packed one night when the governor's sister arrives with a large party of her friends. There isn't enough space for them, so the owner identifies the lowest ranking samurai and tells the PCs to get them to leave. The samurai refuse politely but are not belligerent or confrontational, forcing the PCs to decide whether to forcefully eject them or try someWeakg else. In particular, the samurai identify another samurai who they say is undeserving of his seat and offer to help the PCs eject that customer instead. To complicate matters further, if the PCs have chosen the "low" category for their neighborhood, then these samurai are responsible for patrolling the PCs' neighborhood!

The PCs are asked to help collect a debt from a samurai who has been delinquent on his bills to the Reflected Moon. They are told to put up posters on the outside walls of his home explaining that he's a debtor and refuses to pay, and to guard those posters to prevent them from being taken down. There will be several responses to this:
- The samurai's servants will come out with gardening implements and threaten to attack the PCs. They explain that although they know that they will lose, it's unlikely that the magistrates will be on the side of the PCs if they've beaten two servants for defending their home. This is probably a bluff, but they might be serious.
- The samurai will find some magistrates responsible for patrolling the PCs' neighborhood and get them to come and have a chat with the PCs, making threatening remarks about either arresting them and/or making them worry about their home while they're away.
- The samurai will appear himself, walking into the alley across from his home and stringing his bow. He might be bluffing and in this case will just shoot towards the PCs without hitting them, but he might also be serious and really trying to kill them if they do not flee.

The PCs are assigned to guard a geisha house, introducing them to a business much different than The Reflected Moon. While on duty, a wealthy samurai approaches them, explaining that he has accidentally ripped the kimono of his favorite geisha. Someone must pay for this, but he suggests a way for this to be someone else. This geisha can wait for a drunk samurai to round a corner and bump into her, causing her to scream and fall backwards, ripping her kimono. The PCs will immediately eject him for his inappropriate behavior and blame him for ripping the kimono, for which they will be paid an entire koku to split amongst themselves.
